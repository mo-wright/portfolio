                <h2>Some Notes About the Selections</h2>
            <h3>The Twin Peaks scripts were sourced from <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tvwriting/us-drama/us-drama-collections/twin-peaks?authuser=0">TV Writing</a>. The majority of the scripts were scanned by runningdog. A substantial amount from these scans were cleaned out for my purposes, including some annotations and a few instances of markup separating scenes. The general content is otherwise unchanged.</h3>
                <h3>A special thanks to <a href="https://insidethex.co.uk/">Inside the X</a> for the X-Files scripts. The original contents are unchanged except for some cleanup for the purposes of AntConc/Voyant streamlining.</h3>

            <h2>Twin Peaks</h2>
            <h3>Top 250 Most Frequent 1-grams</h3>
            <p>As suspected, Twin Peak's main protagonist, Special Agent Dale Cooper, takes up the most room in the original run's script. The majority of terms showing up even comparatively often are other main characters. Being a story with many different perspectives followed, this is hardly unexpected. It appears that Detective Truman, Donna Hayward, and Ben Horne are either referred to the most or have the most dialogue.</p>
            <p>"Continued" shows up as the second most frequent 1-gram because of how the scripts appear to be formatted. As the scans were sourced from the official scripts used, this gives us some insight into how the writers chose to break up the show. Twin Peaks is a linear story.</p>

            <h2>X-Files</h2>
            <h3>Top 250 Most Frequent 1-grams</h3>
            <p>Once again, we see main character names taking the forefront of the word cloud. However, the most notable diversion from the Twin Peaks cloud is how much more relative space these titles take up. This is mostly attributed to the fact that there are only two characters the show follows comprehensively. With that said, it is worth noting that Mulder's name appears in the scripts for the first two seasons 8,313 times - while Scully's only shows up 5,822 times (nearly 30% less!)</p>
            <p>Each episode of X-Files, from a script standpoint, was broken up into scenes. Twin Peaks, on the other hand, had its episodes broken up into acts.</p>
