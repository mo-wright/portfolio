        <h1>The Domovoi</h1>
        <div class="centerdom">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p class="indent">The Domovoi was developed by Kevin Snow, based off of a Slavic myth of
                the same name. It draws primarily from Russian history, culture, and folklore. The
                player advises <b>The Storyteller</b> on how their tale of <b>the Domovoi</b> should
                progress and eventually end. You can download the game <a
                    href="https://bravemule.itch.io/domovoi">here.</a>
            </p>
            <h3>Spoilers ahead!</h3>

            <p class="indent"><i>The Domovoi</i> was made with the <a href="https://twinery.org/">Twine</a>
                engine, and as such, runs completely in-browser. It functions essentially as a
                visual novel. The player clicks an embedded option to select it. Canonically, these
                selections are the player character's recommendations to the Storyteller on what
                should happen next in the story of the Domovoi they are workshopping for a crowd. Typically, these actions have to do with the actions the Domovoi itself does. Depending on your selection, you will unlock different elements of the story. The game is not entirely nonlinear, though, as there are story beats that play out no matter what you select. Furthermore, for the vast majority of endings, the outcome and fate of the Domovoi remain the same. See the story analysis section of this page for more details.</p>
            <p class="indent">Where <i>The Domovoi</i> shines is in its replayability and its character work displayed in regards to the player character. While a player is unlikely to change the story, the writing is compelling enough where there is incentive to try out all of the options available.</p>
            <p class="indent">Because of the story-driven nature of the game, it stands to reason
                that the aesthetics are meant to enhance the plot. More importantly, I'd argue, is
                the atmosphere. Music is minimal and many sound effects come in the form of ambient
                noise, such as outdoor wind noises. The illustrations are digitally painted by
                Patrick Bonaduce. Snowy landscape, firelight, folktale atmosphere.</p>
            <p>Gameplay: branching paths, choices matter in some capacity, like a choose your own
                adventure book. bring that up w/ the visual novel comparison?</p>
            <p>Story itself: again, folktale!!! engrossing and almost nostalgic. fits the winter
                theme. slavic influences. no spoilers.</p>
