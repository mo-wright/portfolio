        <h1>The Domovoi</h1>
        <div class="center">
            <figure><h2>The Game</h2></figure>
            <figure><p>The Domovoi was developed by Kevin Snow, based off of a Slavic myth of the
                    same name. You can download it <a href="https://bravemule.itch.io/domovoi"
                        >here.</a>
                </p></figure>
            <p style="display:inline-block;">Upon loading up the game, which runs completely in-browser,
                you're sure to notice that The Domovoi does not play like the mystery-based action
                horror the art style seems to imply. Instead, you are ushered into what is
                essentially a visual novel, with the bulk of "gameplay" involving the clicking of
                links. This is not innately a bad thing in the slightest. It is clear that Snow intended the story to take center stage.</p>
            <p>Because of the story-driven nature of the game, it stands to reason that the aesthetics are meant to enhance the plot. More importantly, I'd argue, is the atmosphere. Music is minimal and many sound effects come in the form of ambient noise, such as outdoor wind noises. The illustrations are digitally painted by Patrick Bonaduce. Snowy landscape, firelight, folktale atmosphere.</p>

            <p>Gameplay: branching paths, choices matter in some capacity, like a choose your own adventure book. bring that up w/ the visual novel comparison?</p>
            <p>Story itself: again, folktale!!! engrossing and almost nostalgic. fits the winter theme. slavic influences. no spoilers.</p>
