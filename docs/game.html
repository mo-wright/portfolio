        <h1>The Domovoi</h1>
        <div class="centerdom">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p class="indent">The Domovoi was developed by Kevin Snow, based off of a Slavic myth of
                the same name. It draws primarily from Russian history, culture, and folklore. The
                player advises <b>The Storyteller</b> on how their tale of <b>the Domovoi</b> should
                progress and eventually end. You can download the game <a
                    href="https://bravemule.itch.io/domovoi">here.</a>
            </p>

            <p class="indent"><i>The Domovoi</i> was made with the <a href="https://twinery.org/"
                    >Twine</a> engine, and as such, runs completely in-browser. It functions
                essentially as a visual novel. The player clicks an embedded option to select it.
                Canonically, these selections are the player character's recommendations to the
                Storyteller on what should happen next in the story of the Domovoi they are
                workshopping for a crowd. Typically, these actions have to do with the actions the
                Domovoi itself does. Depending on your selection, you will unlock different elements
                of the story. The game is not entirely nonlinear, though, as there are story beats
                that play out no matter what you select. Furthermore, for the vast majority of
                endings, the outcome and fate of the Domovoi remain the same. See the <a
                    href="#story">story analysis</a> section of this page for more details.</p>
            <p class="indent">Where <i>The Domovoi</i> shines is in its replayability and its
                character work displayed in regards to the player character. While a player is
                unlikely to change the story, the writing is compelling enough where there is
                incentive to try out all of the options available. Furthermore, you can complete the
                game in a few minutes, depending on how fast of a reader you are. The "gameplay
                loop" is thus replaying over and over again. Despite how repetitive it sounds, this
                is a rewarding endeavor.</p>

            <h3>Visuals</h3>
            <p class="indent">All of the art in this game are digital illustrations by Patrick
                Bonaduce. They're painterly in nature, calling to mind oil paintings with their use
                of somewhat blobby swaths of color and emphasis on scenery. One of the most striking
                things to me is how many empty scenery shots this game employs. It is supremely
                effective at setting the stage: a dark, lonely, winter day, with a small cast of
                characters within a cabin. The outside is in cool colors. The indoors are warm, except when the Domovoi is in danger. These illustrations do a great job of allowing the player
                to feel the cold, lonely themes of the story visually.</p>

            <h3>Audio</h3>
            <p class="indent">Interestingly, the soundtrack of <i>The Domovoi</i> is incredibly
                minimal. There isn't a backing track to gameplay. Instead, ambient wind noise
                permeates the majority of outdoor shots, and perhaps the soft crackling of fire when
                the oven is on screen. At other times the player is in complete silence.
                Contextually sensical ambient noise is the M.O. of this game. The only times this is
                defied is when there is a sound effect going along with an action, such as a
                particularly startling gunshot when the Domovoi meets its demise in several of the
                endings. This only contributes to the ambience that is so central to this story. The
                player is forced to really pay attention to the words they are reading. While on the
                surface it isn't much to write home about, the sound design here suits <i>The
                    Domovoi</i> perfectly.</p>

            <h2 id="story">Story Analysis</h2>
            <iframe class="kumu" src="https://embed.kumu.io/c1a0950d05cb28e52efdd3c2bc76f913"></iframe>
            <p class="indent">In a game where choices matter, the most logical course of action for
                analysis is to look at said options. I replayed the game a few times, choosing as
                many different options as I could at different points, and tried to figure out what
                each word you clicked resulted in. The majority of decisions made involve clicking
                on some sort of symbolic item. They are thus represented on this Kumu graph as
                objects. Notably, there are also a few concepts you choose to value at different
                points, namely Religion vs. Tradition. These are also represented.</p>
            <p class="indent">It is worth noting that the game takes place almost across two
                "worlds". The player character and the storyteller are "real", so to speak, while
                everything else is a part of a story told by the character I've dubbed the Storyteller.
                For the purposes of this graph, it is the Player (as a character) who makes many
                central decisions and is connected to several of them. However, when the selection
                the Player makes is an action done by the Domovoi, it is connected to the Domovoi
                itself. In a way, the player never directly controls the Domovoi, but the Player
                does. I feel this is an important distinction to make.</p>
            <p class="indent">I have also marked items that are selectable but only as ways to move
                to the next slide. These include the wicker broom and the cigarette. These do not
                have any actions associated with them other than how another non-controllable
                character interacts with them. They are connected to these respective
                characters. This does hav the consequence of lading to some looping, such as with the Soldier and his cigarette.</p>
            <p class="indent">As stated before, most endings wind up with the Domovoi meeting its
                demise in some form. It, any other deceased characters, and the instruments of death
                are connected to Death as a concept. Objects are related to their outcome of use.
                Characters are related to the outcome they meet. For these reasons, mapped items are
                sized by their indegree, so we can see which outcomes, characters, and items are
                most prevalent, giving us insight into central themes. Predictably, the titular
                character is the largest, but this is moreso because of what happens with him rather
                than arbitrarily by name alone.</p>
