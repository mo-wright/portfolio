        <h1>The Domovoi</h1>
        <div class="centerdom">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p class="indent">The Domovoi was developed by Kevin Snow, based off of a Slavic myth of
                the same name. It draws primarily from Russian history, culture, and folklore. The
                player advises <b>The Storyteller</b> on how their tale of <b>the Domovoi</b> should
                progress and eventually end. You can download the game <a
                    href="https://bravemule.itch.io/domovoi">here.</a>

            <p class="indent">The Domovoi was made with the <a href="https://twinery.org/">Twine</a>
                engine, and as such, runs completely in-browser. It functions essentially a </p>
            <p class="indent">Because of the story-driven nature of the game, it stands to reason
                that the aesthetics are meant to enhance the plot. More importantly, I'd argue, is
                the atmosphere. Music is minimal and many sound effects come in the form of ambient
                noise, such as outdoor wind noises. The illustrations are digitally painted by
                Patrick Bonaduce. Snowy landscape, firelight, folktale atmosphere.</p>
            <p>Gameplay: branching paths, choices matter in some capacity, like a choose your own
                adventure book. bring that up w/ the visual novel comparison?</p>
            <p>Story itself: again, folktale!!! engrossing and almost nostalgic. fits the winter
                theme. slavic influences. no spoilers.</p>
