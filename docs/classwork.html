            <h3>You are currently on my GitHub Page!</h3>
            <p>This GitHub page was made using HTML via the oXygen editor. However, there is a sister site (accessible <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/portfolimo">here!</a>), containing the same content, made using WordPress and that service's in-house editor. The intention here was to compare the two mediums of website creation and analyze the benefits of one over the other. </p>
            <h3>Comparing the Two</h3>
            <p>HTML is, by definition, a programming language. Like any language, it takes practice and effort to get a firm grasp on the words, language, and syntax it uses to communicate. Each tag is a sentence, each line of code saying something new, each new feature an expansion of one's vocabulary. When a language is understood, it is a beautiful thing. However, it would be presumptous to imply that there does not exist a substantial learning curve. Someone who is not as tech-savvy may find all of the rules and technicalities of HTML nonintuitive. With so much to learn for even the most basic site, it is easy to see why the act of typing out code to build a website is daunting for many. Structuring out an entire page is one thing. Multiply that by however many pages need to be present to communicate what needs said. Then, there's the arduous process of linking them together in a way that makes sense to both the programmer and the user. This isn't to mention the styling process, which involves incremental modifications piece-by-piece and knowledge of aesthetic. The amount of work necessary makes a self-built, HTML website difficult to recommend for a beginner.</p>
            <p>WordPress, on the other hand, is built around intuitiveness. The user interface seems to actively discourage rooting around in the nitty-gritty code underneath the fluff, although it is possible to do so to an extent. The primary aesthetics revolve around premade themes a user can select from. Afterwards, the website designing process becomes all about changing the details on a rigid created structure. Someone looking for a quick landing site or supplemental page will find ease in this format. The issue, here, is that this doesn't allow for much in the way of customization. During the creation of my WordPress page, I found myself wanting to make microadjustments or small structural changes that just weren't possible. While the WordPress site is ultimately functional, it doesn't truly feel like my own work. This also has the added consequence of WordPress sites looking generally homogenous to one another. It is difficult to carve out a unique space on the internet with WordPress. Compare this to a custom-built HTML site, where the placement of anything and everything is up to the coder. There are difficulties in getting everything to line up in just the way imagined, sure, but it is possible.</p>
            <p>When all is said and done, the choice between WordPress or an HTML-based approach to web design comes down to how much effort the purpose of a website necessitates. Despite the hands-off nature of a WordPress site, there are definitely skills that need to be developed to make full use of the platform. Namely, one must become creative with their restraints. The small bits of code the creator of a website does have access to can be used for page-by-page customization. Using HTML in ways you may not in your own built website therefore becomes imperative. Something also worth considering with WordPress is the importance of accessibility. WordPress encourages developers to add alt text and variable formatting in order to make their websites more accessible to people using screenreaders and other web aides. This sort of cyber-empathy is something that I feel I could improve upon greatly. The creation of alt text in HTML is more of an afterthought, as it is completely optional and a functional website can be compiled without any accessibility checking. Otherwise, though, WordPress doesn't appear to require much more outside skill. What's most important is learning your way around the various menus and their functions. </p> 
            <p>In the case of HTML, organizational and streamlining skills are key. It is easy to have segments of code that contradict each other, or segments that are purely redundant. This makes diagnosing problems or unintended formatting harder to diagnose. Similarly, having one's CSS formatted in a logical way isn't purely necessary for functionality, but it makes debugging and sitewide edits significantly easier. I will be the first to admit that my HTML website is not as streamlined or organized as it could be. A large portion of my internal streamlining has occured in coding sessions dedicated just to cleanup. Improving this skill would prevent any future organizational time sinks.</p>
            <p>For my own uses, the HTML site most aligns with my mission statement. Full customization through coding means the most to me. However, as a landing page builder, WordPress functions completely. Both require separate skills to make full use of - it is important to understand, though, that these uses are fundamentally different. It may be difficult to say one is better than the other for this reason. </p>
