                                  
               In DARKNESS the sound of a meadowlark's song.

               FADE IN:

               THE MEADOWLARK

               The bright eye and beak of the bird, backlit by the first 
               light of the rising sun.


               A long, straight, empty stretch of road leads up between two 
               mountains, Whitetail and Blue Pine, the Twin Peaks.


               The picturesque center of the town of Twin Peaks; a small, 
               neatly manicured park with a pristine white gazebo its 
               centerpiece. Fronting the park is the '30's-style streamlined, 
               concrete and glass City Hall. An early rising MAN walks two 
               Irish setters through the square.


               In the shadow of a smaller mountain Sparkwood Hill, we see 
               the slightly run down business district, the core of Twin 
               Peaks' old downtown. A slow-moving freight train rumbles 
               through the train station.


               A quiet, tree-lined street. White, clapboard houses with 
               open porches. A MILKMAN carries a crate of clinking milk 
               bottles up the steps to one of the houses. Behind him, a 
               yellow schoolbus cruises slowly by.


               Where Sparkwood Road meets Highway "21", a traffic light 
               cycles from green to yellow to red.


               On the highway. Not yet open for business. - No sign of life.


               A dog drifts through a parking lot, littered with last night's 
               trash and beer bottles. The club's neon patron-snatcher 
               flickers back and forth between two images of a couple doing 
               the jitterbug.


               Open for business. Two Diesel rigs idle in the oil-stained 
               gravel lot outside. A couple of nighthawks sober up at the 
               counter. A pretty country-western ballad plays on the jukebox 
               inside.


               An imposing granite structure overlooks the city from high 
               on White Tail Mountain, one of the Twin Peaks. Automatic 
               sprinklers kick on across the vast green-black lawns.


               A massive industrial structure on the south shore of Black 
               Lake. Sawdust and steam shoot out of funnels and pipes. A 
               distant tug shepherds a logjam towards the sawmill gates. A 
               piercing steam whistle signals the end of the night shift.


               Outside the huge log house, called Blue Pine Lodge, PETE 
               MARTELL, a late-middle-aged man, sets some fishing gear in 
               the back of a pick-up, then goes inside.


               Pete grabs a thermos of coffee and an apple, kisses his wife, 
               KATHERINE PACKARD MARTELL, a sturdy, weathered woman, mid-
               fifties, fully dressed, at the table, newspaper and coffee 
               in hand. She doesn't react to the kiss. Pete exits.



               GIOVANNA PASQUALINI PACKARD, a beautiful woman in her 
               thirties, wearing a silk negligee, sits at a vanity table, 
               combing her hair, lost in a dreamy state of mind. From 
               outside, she hears Pete's pick-up drive off, turns to look 
               out the bedroom's large picture window.



               Looking down to the shores of Black Lake. A large logjam is 
               visible near the sawmill dock.



               Pete lifts his fishing gear from the pick-up end walks out 
               onto the dock to drop a line.


               PETE

               He's about to cast out his line when his expression changes; 
               he sees something horrible. He sets his tackle and makes his 
               way down a wooden stairway to a landing at water level. He 
               jumps across a gap of dark, oil-slicked water onto the edge 
               of a cabled log-raft. He steps cautiously across the shiny, 
               barkless logs, slowing as he approaches what it was that 
               caught his eye...


               A WOMAN'S BODY

               Face down, lying on the log raft, cut, bruised, broken and 
               lifeless.

               PETE

               Shaking, he turns to go for help.



               Highway "21", empty, running up between the twin peaks. A 
               flying wedge of motorcycle riders driving Harleys ride into 
               view; seven young men, all between seventeen and twenty-one, 
               clean-cut, wearing black leather jackets. With MAIN TITLES 
               and MUSIC over, we see the gang ride through various parts 
               of the city.



               Pete, the middle-aged man, hurriedly punches in a number on 
               a pay phone at the end of the dock.

                                     PETE
                         Lucy, put Dan on the horn.


                SHERIFFS OFFICE - DAWN

               SHERIFF DAN STEADMAN, rugged, early forties, pours his first 
               cup of coffee, as the dispatcher, LUCY MORAN, turns to him 
               from the switchboard.

                                     LUCY
                         Sheriff, sounds like Pete Martell up 
                         at the Mill.

               Steadman punches line one and picks up the call.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Sheriff Steadman... now hold on a 
                         second, Pete, where?... you stay 
                         right there, I'm on my way.

               He hangs up, grabs his hat and coat and heads for the door.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (to Lucy)
                         You better get Dr. Hayward, tell him 
                         to meet me up at the Packard Mill, 
                         the dock right below the dam - and 
                         roust that Andy out of bed, tell him 
                         to get his butt up there now.

                                     LUCY
                         What is it?

                                     STEADMAN
                         We got a body up there. You don't 
                         say a word to anybody till you hear 
                         from me.

               Steadman exits.


               Steadman hops into his souped-up Diamond County Sheriff's 
               Department cruiser, fires up the big V-8 and rooster-tails 
               it towards the highway, as his red and blue toplights start 
               spinning.


               Steadman pulls up, lights still spinning, just as the Diamond 
               County Coroner's station wagon pulls up alongside. Steadman 
               gets out and joins DR. WILLIAM HAYWARD, the Medical Examiner, 
               a tall, distinguished gray-haired man of sixty, and they 
               move towards the dock.

                                     HAYWARD
                         What've we got?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Let's go find out.

               They make their way down the wooden steps to the log raft. 
               Waiting there are Pete, his wife Katherine and Giovanna 
               Packard, wearing a coat over a brocade bathrobe, her beautiful 
               hair and make-up in stark contrast to the harsh surroundings.

                                     PETE
                         We haven't touched anything.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Thanks, Pete.
                              (tips his hat)
                         Mrs. Packard... Katherine...

                                     KATHERINE
                         Our security guard didn't see 
                         anything.

               Steadman nods, he and Hayward move forward to the body, on 
               the edge of the logs. Without touching anything, Hayward 
               kneels beside the body and begins to examine details.

                                     HAYWARD
                         You want forensics first?

                                     STEADMAN
                              (shakes his head)
                         She's been in the water. Go ahead.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Let's get some pictures.

               Above them, on the dock, DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN, young, 
               intelligent but awkward and shy, climbs down the stairs, 
               carrying a forensic examination kit and a camera.

                                     ANDY
                         You need the kit, Sheriff? I've got 
                         the kit.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Good. Bring that camera down here, 
                         Andy.

                                     ANDY
                         Right.
                              (as he passes the 
                              others)
                         Ladies... Pete.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Doc wants some pictures before we 
                         turn her over.

                                     ANDY
                              (staring at the body)
                         Who is she?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Andy, the camera. Then we'll turn 
                         her over and find out.

                                     ANDY
                         Sorry. Sure. Okay.

               Andy puts down the kit and shoots various angles of her back, 
               as the others stand out of the way. Andy kneels down to get 
               a closer shot, pauses, slumps back down to a sitting position 
               and starts to weep.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Oh, Andy.

                                     STEADMAN
                         My God, Andy. Same thing as Last 
                         year in Mr. Blodgett's barn.

                                     ANDY
                         Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Is this gonna happen every damn time?

                                     HAYWARD
                         Give me the camera, Andy.

               Hayward takes the camera from him and takes some more 
               pictures. Steadman notices that a crowd of mill workers are 
               gathering above on the dock.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (giving him an out)
                         Andy, get up on the dock and dear 
                         that crowd back.

                                     ANDY
                         Okay, Dan. Sorry.

               Drying his eyes, Andy walks back and starts up the ladder.

               Hayward takes a closeup of the girl's wrist, where he's found 
               some small, distinctive wounds. He puts the camera down on 
               the forensic kit.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Let's turn her over. Give me a hand 
                         here.

               Steadman and Hayward grasp her by the shoulders and knees 
               end gently turn the body over.


               THE GIRL'S HEAD

               As the body turns and the face comes into view.


               STEADMAN AND HAYWARD

               Seeing the face, they're both hit with a shock of recognition.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Oh Lord. Laura...

                                     STEADMAN
                         Laura Palmer.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Sweet Jesus...

                                     GIOVANNA
                              (shocked)
                         Laura? Is it Laura?

               Steadman looks back towards the others, where Giovanna has 
               stepped forward towards them. He catches her eye. Nods.


               A quiet, upper middle-class neighborhood. Manicured lawns. A 
               PAPERBOY rides by on a bike, flings a paper onto the front 
               steps of the Palmer house.

               SARAH PALMER, a thin, nervous chain-smoker, mid-forties, 
               turns some bacon over on the griddle, lights a cigarette and 
               goes to the bottom of the stairs.

                                     SARAH
                         Laura, sweetheart, I'm not gonna 
                         tell you again!
                              (silence; she waits)
                         Laura!
                              (no response; to 
                              herself)
                         Oh for goodness sakes...

               She starts up the stairs.


               Sarah opens the door to Laura's bedroom.

                                     SARAH
                              (annoyed)
                         Laura, now means now--

               She stops short. Laura's bed has apparently been slept in 
               but there's no one in the room. Sarah walks down the hall to 
               the bathroom and knocks on the door.

                                     SARAH
                         Laura?

               No answer. She tries the door, opens it. No one inside. Sarah 
               goes back into the hall, starting to worry.

                                     SARAH
                              (louder)
                         Laura! Honey, are you downstairs?

               She goes into Laura's room. Notices for the first time that 
               the window is open and the lace curtains are blowing in the 
               breeze.

               Sarah picks up the white princess phone beside Laura's bed, 
               dials and waits for someone to answer.

                                     SARAH
                              (into the phone)
                         Bette, it's Sarah, listen, I just 
                         came up to wake Laura and she's not 
                         here, is she with Bobby?


               BETTY BRIGGS, a healthy, solid woman, early forties, is on 
               the phone. Her husband, MAJOR GARLAND BRIGGS, a rock-hard 
               Air Force career man, sits at the table in background, ramrod-
               stiff, drinking black coffee.

                                     BETTY
                              (into the phone)
                         She might be, Sarah, but Bobby leaves 
                         here about five to go running and 
                         then goes on to football practice.

                                     SARAH
                         Can you reach him? Can you find out? 
                         I'll call the school--

                                     BETTY
                         I've got the number of the fieldhouse 
                         here, let me get that for you--it's 
                         474--

                                     SARAH
                              (writing it down)
                         Thanks, Bette--
                              (a new idea)
                         You know, I'm wondering if she might 
                         have gone out with Leland, he had an 
                         early meeting--

                                     BETTY
                         I'm sure that's it, or she's with 
                         Bobby--

                                     SARAH
                         Sure, let me call up to the hotel, 
                         thanks.

               She hangs up, then starts to dial another number.


               MAX HARTMAN, the genial, verbose football coach, picks up 
               the phone at the fieldhouse window. Football players are 
               practicing on the field in background.

                                     HARTMAN
                              (into the phone)
                         Yeah, hello, this is the Coach... 
                         yeah, Mrs. Palmer, no, Bobby didn't 
                         show up for practice yet, matter of 
                         fact, come to think of it, he's been 
                         late every day this week, possibly 
                         even last week and the week before, 
                         although he might be here before you 
                         know it--well, I could have him call 
                         you Mrs. Palmer, is it urgent?... 
                         okay, sure, fine.



               Re-establish.



               A group of fifteen NORWEGIAN BUSINESSMEN sit around an 
               executive dining table, talking animatedly in Norwegian while 
               consuming an immense, hearty breakfast.


               In an inner office, BENJAMIN HORNE, a roguish, charismatic 
               man, mid-forties looks in at the Norwegians, then consults 
               with his lawyer, LELAND PALMER, a handsome, refined man of 
               fifty, who takes a sheath of legal contracts from a briefcase 
               and shows them to Horne.

                                     HORNE
                              (glancing at the 
                              contracts)
                         Are they ready to sign?

                                     LELAND
                         You don't want to mention to them 
                         that we don't as yet have access to 
                         the Packard land--

                                     HORNE
                         By the time we're ready to start 
                         building we'll have that land, what 
                         they don't know won't hurt them--
                              (holds up a hand to 
                              silence him)
                         --I have solid information that the 
                         Packard Sawmill will go belly-up 
                         within a year. We will buy it for a 
                         song; one verse, no chorus.
                              (hands back the 
                              contracts)
                         Let's go get these cheese-eaters 
                         where they live.

               As they move into the dining room, we MOVE to a LARGE MAP on 
               the wall, topographical of Twin Peaks and environs.

               On the map, in a red-shaded area northeast of the Packard 
               Sawmill on Black Lake we see the words: "PROPOSED SITE FOR 
               GHOSTWOOD COUNTRY CLUB AND ESTATES"


               Benjamin Home stands at the head of a table, addressing the 
               fifteen Norwegian businessmen. Beside him, an INTERPRETER 
               translates each sentence into Norwegian. Leland Palmer sits 
               at Horne's right hand.

                                     HORNE
                              (in the middle of his 
                              spiel)
                         ...and great opportunities for growth 
                         and expansion with a minimal capital 
                         outlay... a clean and wholesome 
                         environment much like your own... 
                         with a quality of life to rival the 
                         best our country can offer... of 
                         course when I first spoke to Sven he 
                         was naturally concerned about the 
                         air here... if you'll permit me to 
                         repeat what you told me after your 
                         run this morning, Sven...
                              (pounds his chest 
                              enthusiastically)
                         "My air sacs never felt so good!"

               After the translation, the group all nod good-naturedly and 
               SVEN turns red. During which a HOTEL EMPLOYEE enters and 
               discreetly whispers something to Leland Palmer. Palmer nods 
               and rises.

                                     LELAND
                         Excuse me a moment, gentleman.
                              (he stars out)

                                     HORNE
                         So you see, here in Twin Peaks, 
                         industry and health go hand in hand... 
                         a harmonious and beneficial 
                         coexistence...

               Palmer exits.


               A waiting room with a large picture window looking out on 
               the front lawn. Leland Palmer enters and picks up the phone.

                                     LELAND
                         Leland Palmer...


               Sarah Palmer, on the phone in the kitchen, lighting another 
               cigarette with the butt of the one she's just finishing.

                                     SARAH
                         Honey, it's Sarah, is Laura with 
                         you?

                                     LELAND
                         No, why?

                                     SARAH
                              (slightly hysterical)
                         She didn't go with you this morning?

                                     LELAND
                         No, what's wrong, what's this about?

                                     SARAH
                         She's not here, she wasn't here this 
                         morning--

               Looking out the window, Leland sees Sheriff Steadman drive 
               up, park and walk towards the hotel.

                                     LELAND
                         She's probably with Bobby--

                                     SARAH
                         I can't find him--

                                     LELAND
                         Well that's it then, let's not worry--

                                     SARAH
                         She would've left a note, why didn't 
                         she tell me? Why didn't she leave me 
                         a note?

                                     LELAND
                         Sarah, calm down, darling, please...

               Looking out towards the lobby he sees Steadman, speaking to 
               the DESK CLERK, who points in to where Leland is on the phone. 
               The Sheriff sees Leland, locks eyes with him and starts 
               walking towards him.

                                     LELAND
                              (the first hint of 
                              alarm, to himself)
                         Sheriff Steadman...

                                     SARAH
                              (panicking)
                         Who? What did you say?

                                     LELAND
                              (trying to cover)
                         Please. Sarah. I'm going to have to 
                         call you back.

                                     SARAH
                              (seeing it all, coming 
                              unglued)
                         Oh my God... oh my God, Laura, no, 
                         Laura!

                                     LELAND
                         Sarah...

               The Sheriff reaches Leland, hat in hand. Leland covers the 
               mouthpiece of the phone.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Mr. Palmer...

                                     LELAND
                         Is this about Laura?

                                     STEADMAN
                         I'm afraid it is, sir.

               We hear Sarah screaming for Leland over the phone.


               SARAH

                                     SARAH
                         Leland, what is it? My baby! Tell 
                         me, oh God, Leland!


               LELAND

               Having heard the news, he goes back to the phone.

                                     LELAND
                              (trembling, trying to 
                              stay calm)
                         Sarah, I'm on my way home... please, 
                         Sarah.

               He hangs up. Picks up and struggling to remember the number, 
               unsteadily punches it in.

                                     LELAND
                         Janice, this is Leland, oh God...
                              (he's momentarily 
                              overcome, then)
                         ...I want you to go next door and 
                         stay with Sarah until I get there--
                         please just do it.

               He hangs up.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Let me drive you, sir.

               Palmer nods, points vaguely back towards the meeting room.

                                     LELAND
                         I, uh, should tell Mr. Horne and 
                         the...

                                     STEADMAN
                         I'm sure they'll understand.

               Benjamin Horne appears in the doorway.

                                     HORNE
                         Leland, we're ready to go over the 
                         contracts...
                              (sees him)
                         Leland?

                                     LELAND
                         My daughter's dead.


               JANICE HOGAN, the Palmer's next door neighbor, exits the 
               front door of her house and runs next door to the Palmers' 
               house. She knocks on the door. We hear a heart-rending wail 
               of grief from inside.

                                     JANICE
                         Sarah?!

               She opens she door and rushes inside. Pause.  Another cry.


               Re-establish. A Volkswagen beetle pulls up and a UNIFORMED 
               WAITRESS gets out and goes inside.

                                                                    

                DOUBLE "R" DINER - MORNING

               SHELLY JOHNSON, a young, slim waitress, is putting on her 
               coat, as the other waitress, HEIDI, a hefty German girl, 
               enters. The owner of the diner, NORMA JENNINGS, a statuesque, 
               well-preserved forty year old former beauty queen, pours a 
               warm-up for BOBBY BRIGGS, handsome, muscular high school 
               senior, wearing a letter jacket.

                                     SHELLY
                              (popping gum)
                         What kept ya, Heidi? Seconds on 
                         knockwurst this morning?

               Heidi, a bubbly, easily embarrassed girl, giggles and blushes.

                                     HEIDI
                         I couldn't get my car started.

                                     SHELLY
                         Too busy jumpstartin' the old man.

                                     BOBBY
                         Thought you Germans were always on 
                         time.

                                     NORMA
                         Bobby, I thought the only time you 
                         cared about was makin' time.

               Bobby and Shelly exchange a slightly guilty look. Bobby rises, 
               puts some change on the counter.

                                     BOBBY
                         Hey, Shelly, you headin' out?

                                     SHELLY
                         Headin' home.

                                     BOBBY
                         I gotta go to practice, I could drop 
                         you at your place on the way.

                                     SHELLY
                         That'd be great, thanks.

                                     BOBBY
                              (as they go, holds up 
                              a quarter)
                         Here's a tune for you gals. Norma, 
                         I'll see you in my dreams.

                                     NORMA
                         Not if I see you first.

                                     BOBBY
                         Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

               He drops the quarter in a jukebox, punches a song in. Bobby 
               and Shelly exit the diner as an aggressively cheerful German 
               Polka blares from the jukebox.

                                                                    

                DINER - MORNING

               Bobby opens the door of his souped-up Buick Electra '88 
               convertible for Shelly.

                                     BOBBY
                              (under his breath)
                         I think she knows about us.

                                     SHELLY
                         Norma? Fat chance. She's probably 
                         hot to trot for you herself.

               She gets in.

                                                                    

                BOBBY'S CAR - MORNING

               Bobby climbs in behind the wheel and starts the car. They 
               look around for a moment, make sure no one is watching them, 
               then kiss hotly.

                                     SHELLY
                         I was thinkin' about you.

                                     BOBBY
                         Yeah?

                                     SHELLY
                         All night.
                              (she caresses him 
                              intimately)

                                     BOBBY
                         All right.

               He steps on it and peels out of the parking lot.

                                                                    

                LUCKY HIGHWAY "21" - MORNING

               As they drive down the highway, a Sheriff's cruiser, lights 
               and siren blaring, approaches them, headed the other way.

                                                                    

                BOBBY'S CAR - MORNING

               Shelly and Bobby watch the cruiser as it zooms by them, then 
               look back. She takes a pull off a silver flask and knocks it 
               back. Bobby looks at her.

                                     SHELLY
                         Hey, it's happy hour in France.
                              (offers it to Bobby)
                         Come on. Breakfast of champions.

                                     BOBBY
                         Right. 'Little pick-me-up before 
                         Home Room.

                                     SHELLY
                         Thought I was your little pick-me-
                         up.

                                     BOBBY
                         Baby, you're more like a three-stage 
                         rocket. A pocket rocket.

                                     SHELLY
                         What stage are we in now?

                                     BOBBY
                         You sure your old man's still on the 
                         road?

                                     SHELLY
                         Called me last night from Tacoma. 
                         Talked dirty to me for an hour. And 
                         he ain't got a phone in his truck.
                              (a highly suggestive 
                              look)
                         Quit worryin' and start scurryin', 
                         Mr. Touchdown.

               Bobby steps on it.

                                                                    

                WINDING ROAD - MORNING

               At the base of Sparkwood Mountain. Bobby drives around a 
               corner and starts up a steep driveway leading to Shelly's 
               house. They drive around another corner and Bobby slams on 
               the brakes when they see the cab of a large semi rig parked 
               in the driveway in front of the house.

                                                                    

                BOBBY'S CAR - MORNING

                                     BOBBY
                         Jesus...

                                     SHELLY
                         He's home. Damn. Damn it.
                              (bangs her head back 
                              against the headrest)

               Bobby throws it into reverse and backs up behind a stand of 
               trees.

                                     SHELLY
                         Damn it. Call you later.

                                                                    

                BOBBY'S CAR - MORNING

               Shelly jumps out of the car. Bobby backs down the driveway 
               at thirty miles an hour.

                                                                    

                BOBBY'S CAR - MORNING

               Bobby drives away from Shelly's. Breathes a sigh of relief.

                                                                    

                PALMER HOUSE - MORNING

               Sheriff Steadman drives his cruiser into the driveway and 
               Leland Palmer steps out on the passenger's car. Mrs. Palmer 
               comes frantically out of the house and down the steps. He 
               stops. She moves close to him, sees the grief in his eyes, 
               then runs to him, screaming, hitting him, sobbing 
               hysterically. He struggles to hold onto her until she 
               collapses in his arms.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               A '30's Federal-style structure on the edge of the old 
               downtown. The Coroner's station wagon is parked outside an 
               entrance to the basement.

                                                                    

                MORGUE CORRIDOR - MORNING

               Dr. Hayward is seated in the corridor. He rises as Leland 
               Palmer and Sheriff Steadman come around the corner.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Leland, I'm so sorry.

                                     LELAND
                         Seventeen years old.

               Hayward puts his arms around his old friend. They embrace. 
               Palmer pulls away. Looks at the door marked "CORONER." Steels 
               himself for what's coming.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Hate to put you through this.

                                     LELAND
                         No. I have to see her. I want to see 
                         what was done to my little girl.

               Steadman leads him through the door.

                                                                    

                MORGUE - MORNING

               Leland watches as a MORGUE ATTENDANT slides open a 
               refrigerated vault holding the body of Laura Palmer. The 
               Attendant removes the sheet. Palmer inhales sharply. His 
               face crumbles. He reaches out blindly, puts a hand on 
               Steadman's shoulder. Steadman holds him up.

               Bobby slows down to cruising speed, pulls up alongside a 
               group of Twin Peaks High School football players, jogging on 
               the other side of a chainlink fence.

                                     BOBBY
                         Hey, suckers.

               MIKE NELSON, one of the players peels off from the group and 
               slows to speak to him.

                                     MIKE
                         Hey, man, you better get your butt 
                         over to school, something's up.

                                     BOBBY
                         That's what she said.

                                     MIKE
                         You think I'm kidding.

                                     BOBBY
                         What, me worry?

               Bobby smiles, taps the accelerator and drives off.

                                                                    

                TWIN PEAKS HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

               Bobby tools into the school parking lot. Gets out. Notices a 
               Sheriff's department cruiser parked outside, lights flashing.

                                                                    

                HIGH SCHOOL MAIN HALL - MORNING

               Bobby enters the building, passes a cluster of kids standing 
               outside the office. Bobby notices the kids staring at him 
               and stares aggressively back.

                                     GIRL WITH GLASSES
                         Bobby Briggs, they're looking for 
                         you.

                                     BOBBY
                         Who is?

                                     ANOTHER KID
                         Sheriff is.

                                     BOBBY
                         Well here I am in school.

               MRS. JACKSON, the Principal's secretary, standing inside the 
               school office, sees Bobby in the hallway through the glass 
               partition. She steps outside to speak to him.

                                     MRS. JACKSON
                         Bobby, you're wanted in the 
                         principal's office.

                                     BOBBY
                         Who wants me in the principal's 
                         office?

                                     MRS. JACKSON
                         Right now, young man.

               Bobby throws a swaggering look back at the group of kids and 
               saunters into the office.

                         ...Martha Grimes... Donna Hayward...

               A very smart and very pretty girl, DONNA HAYWARD, daughter 
               of Dr. Hayward, looks up and responds.

                                     DONNA
                         Here.

               Looking out the door window, Donna notices two State Troopers 
               walking up to the door.

               dark, haunted eyes, raises her hand.

                         Yo.

               One of the State Troopers enters the classroom and signals 
               Honeycutt. The other Trooper remains standing outside the 
               door.

                                     TROOPER #1
                         Excuse me, m'am, is Bobby Briggs in 
                         this class?

                                     HONEYCUTT
                         No, he's in 107.

                                     TROOPER #1
                         Could I speak to you for a moment, 
                         please?

                                     HONEYCUTT
                         Certainly.

               Honeycutt moves over to the Trooper. He speaks quietly to 
               her. The class watches closely.

               A GIRL runs by outside the window, in the interior grass 
               courtyard, crying hysterically.

               A buzz of curiosity builds through the classroom. Mrs. 
               Honeycutt turns and looks towards the seat next to Donna. 
               The one empty seat in the room.

               Donna notices Honeycutt's look. Donna looks at her arms. 
               Covered with goosebumps. Without knowing why, her eyes tear 
               up. Donna turns to look at James. He's staring right at her, 
               sharing the same sudden fear.

               The Second Trooper sticks his head back into the classroom.

                                     TROOPER #2
                         We got him.

               The First Trooper hurries out and they move off down the 
               hall towards the office. Honeycutt turns to the class, her 
               face a mask of unsettled emotions.

                                     HONEYCUTT
                              (voice trembling)
                         There'll be an announcement from the 
                         Principal's office...

               She can't continue, her lip quivering violently. One more 
               word and she'll dissolve in tears. She goes to her desk and 
               sits and stares off into the comer.

                                     DONNA
                              (silently, to herself)
                         Laura...

               A pencil snaps in James' hand.

                                                                    

                PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - MORNING

               The told State Troopers enter the office. Bobby is seated in 
               the middle of the room. Surrounded by Deputy Andy Brennan, a 
               second deputy, a black man, BERNIE HILL, and the School 
               Principal, GEORGE WOLCHEZK, a stolid, pale, balding man, mid-
               fifties.

                                     BOBBY
                              (frightened)
                         --I told you, I got up early like I 
                         always do, I went running like I 
                         always do, I went to breakfast at 
                         the Double "R" and I didn't go to 
                         practice 'cause I didn't feel like 
                         it.

                                     BERNIE
                         Why didn't you feel like it, Bobby? 
                         Were you upset about something?

                                     ANDY
                         Something troubling you, Bobby? You 
                         want to tell us about it?

                                     BOBBY
                         Look, you guys, please, what'd I to? 
                         What's goin' on?

               The door opens. Sheriff Steadman enters. Red-eyed, Mrs. 
               Jackson, Wolchezk's secretary, leans in behind him to say...

                                     MRS. JACKSON
                         Mr. Wolchezk, there's rumors all 
                         over school. Maybe it'd be best if 
                         they heard it from you.

               Wolchezk nods. Steadman indicates to him "just a moment".

                                     BOBBY
                         What is it? What's going on? Sheriff?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Now, Bobby, look at me. Your 
                         girlfriend, Laura Palmer's been 
                         killed. She was found just after 
                         dawn. She was with you last night 
                         and you weren't where you were 
                         supposed to be this morning. Have 
                         these fellas advised you of your 
                         rights?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yes, but I didn't know why--Laura's 
                         dead?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Yes. Did you understand your rights 
                         as they were explained to you?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yeah, Jesus, you think I killed her?

                                     STEADMAN
                              (firmly)
                         Bobby, we're gonna have you make a 
                         phone call, you can call your folks 
                         and they can arrange to get a lawyer 
                         to be with you when we talk some 
                         more--Andy, take Bobby out to make 
                         his call--

                                     BOBBY
                         I loved her! And she loves me!

               Pause. Andy takes Bobby by the arm. Bobby shakes him off.

                                     BOBBY
                         You think 'cause I wasn't at football 
                         practice that I killed my girlfriend? 
                         You guys are nuts!

                                     STEADMAN
                              (no more arguments)
                         Bobby... we're gonna talk about this 
                         later. Mr. Wolchezk, why don't you 
                         go ahead and make that announcement?

               Andy leads Bobby out of the room. Wolchezk nods. Goes to the 
               public address system microphone behind his desk. Picks up 
               the microphone. Flips on the system. Collects himself.

                                     WOLCHEZK
                         May I have your attention please... 
                         may I have your attention... this is 
                         Principal Wolchezk...

                                                                    

                HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR - MORNING

               We slowly drift down the corridor away from the office. Bobby 
               is visible in the office, through the glass partitions, making 
               his phone call. The sound of the announcement fades in and 
               out, echoing through the empty halls as we pass different 
               class rooms.

                                     WOLCHEZK'S VOICE
                              (over)
                         ...I am deeply saddened to have to 
                         tell you that early this morning 
                         your classmate Laura Palmer was found 
                         dead...

               We hear shrieks and cries of grief from the various 
               classrooms.

                                     WOLCHEZK'S VOICE
                         ...this is a terrible moment for all 
                         of us, for all of us who knew her, 
                         her friends and family and it is 
                         important that we all try to help 
                         each other through this difficult 
                         time... the police have asked me to 
                         ask all of you, if you have any 
                         information concerning Laura's 
                         activities after school yesterday, 
                         or yesterday evening to please come 
                         forward... I am hereby suspending 
                         all classes for the day but before 
                         we leave I would like to ask all of 
                         you to join me in observing a moment 
                         of silence...
                              (his voice breaking)
                         ...for Laura and her dear memory...

               We come to rest on a trophy case in the hallway. Prominent 
               among the trophies is a large photo of Laura, wearing a crown 
               and gown, with Bobby in background, and bearing the caption:

                          HOMECOMING QUEEN, 1988, LAURA PALMER.

               We stay on the photo throughout the moment of silence.

                                                                    

               DONNA HAYWARD

               In her classroom, raising her head up after the moment of 
               silence, tears streaming down her face. Another GIRL puts 
               her arms around Donna's shoulders, comforting her. Tears and 
               cries of disbelief from throughout the classroom. Donna looks 
               back at...

                                                                    

               JAMES HURLEY

               Wiping the tears from his eyes, covering up his total 
               emotional destruction.

                                                                    

                PALMER HOUSE - DAY

               Two sheriff's department cruisers and a state trooper's car 
               are parked outside. One of the Troopers we saw at the high 
               school is talking on his radio. a small group of NEIGHBORS 
               have gathered at a discreet distance, watching the house, 
               talking with quiet concern among themselves.

                                                                    

                PALMER HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Sarah Palmer reclines on a Barca-lounger, a cold compress on 
               her forehead. His bag open beside him, Dr. Hayward has just 
               administered an injection to Sarah, discarding the syringe 
               and rolling her sleeve back down her arm. Janice brings Sarah 
               a glass of water.

               Andy Brennan stands at the foot of the stairs. Sheriff 
               Steadman is seated on an ottoman next to Sarah, quietly 
               questioning her.

                                     STEADMAN
                         What time was it when you last saw 
                         Laura, Mrs. Palmer?

                                     SARAH
                              (the sedative taking 
                              effect)
                         What time? Uh, I suppose, let me 
                         see... it would have been about nine 
                         I think, yes, nine o'clock. She came 
                         back from Bobby's and was going up 
                         those stairs, those stairs right 
                         there.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Did she say anything?

                                     SARAH
                              (dreamy)
                         No. She said goodnight. And I said, 
                         "Goodnight, sweetheart" Then I heard 
                         her door close.

               She's close to tears for a moment, then it passes. Hayward 
               takes her hand and holds it. Sarah hears footsteps upstairs.

                                     SARAH
                         Who's upstairs now?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Your husband and one of my men.

                                     SARAH
                         I can tell from the sounds that it 
                         isn't her...

               Steadman and Hayward exchange a look.

                                                                    

                LAURA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Leland Palmer sits on the unmade bed, his hand absent-mindedly 
               brushing the bedspread. Deputy Bernie Hill is unobtrusively 
               searching the room. He opens a dresser drawer beside the bed 
               and discovers a locked diary, embosses with Laura's initials.

                                     BERNIE
                         Do you know where the key for this 
                         is, sir?

                                     LELAND
                              (shakes his head)
                         Do you have to take that?

                                     BERNIE
                         We'll return it as soon as possible.

               Palmer nods. Bernie places the diary in a cardboard box along 
               with other collected evidence; her schoolbooks, letters, 
               etc.

               Bernie moves to and opens the closet door. Turns on an 
               overhead light. The first thing he sees is a video camera 
               sitting on a shelf.

                                                                    

                PALMER LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Steadman continues to gently question Sarah.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Can you remember, Mrs. Palmer... did 
                         she make or receive any phone calls?

                                     SARAH
                         I heard her phone ring once.

                                     STEADMAN
                         About what time was that?

                                     SARAH
                         I don't know who it was...

               The phone rings. Steadman looks at Andy, who goes into the 
               kitchen to answer it.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Do you recall the time?

                                     SARAH
                         I was combing my hair...

                                     STEADMAN
                         You were getting ready for bed.

                                     SARAH
                         Yes. Leland was just coming home...

               She fades. Steadman realizes the interrogation is effectively 
               coming to an end. The doorbell rings. Janice moves to the 
               door, opens it and admits FATHER CLARENCE HUTCHINSON, a 
               rumpled, white-haired Episcopalian minister.

                                     JANICE
                         Father...

                                     FATHER CLARENCE
                              (nods, quietly)
                         How is she?

               Janice takes his hat and coat.

                                     JANICE
                         She's been asking for you.

               Clarence moves into the living room Steadman rises.

                                     FATHER CLARENCE
                              (nodding to the other 
                              men)
                         Sarah?

               Sarah looks up at him. Blinks. He takes her hand, sits beside 
               her.

                                     SARAH
                         There's no more pain now, is there?

                                     CLARENCE
                              (gently, soothing)
                         Our thoughts and prayers guide her 
                         to her rest. And she is at peace, 
                         Sarah. The peace of the just and the 
                         good.

               Sarah sits back, finding some comfort in his words. Returning 
               from the kitchen, Andy signals Steadman over to him.

                                     ANDY
                              (quietly urgent)
                         That was Lucy. Got a call from a guy 
                         works up at the mill, Janek Pulaski. 
                         Says his daughter didn't come home 
                         last night. And she didn't show up 
                         at school today either.

               Off Steadman's concern...

                                                                    

                PACKARD SAWMILL - DAY

               A State Trooper rapidly walks JANEK PULASKI, a barrel-shaped 
               mill worker, past the powerful, ripping saws towards the 
               exit. Pulaski's eyes are red from tears and stress.

                                                                    

                SAWMILL CATWALK - DAY

               On a catwalk outside the office, over the din of the mill, 
               Katherine Packard is confronting Giovanna Packard, as an 
               embarrassed Pete Martell stands by, near a large, control 
               console.

                                     KATHERINE
                         You're not going anywhere and you're 
                         not telling anybody anything!

                                     GIOVANNA
                              (Italian accented, 
                              slightly fractured 
                              syntax)
                         Katherine, I am sorry if this offends 
                         you, but I am the owner of this 
                         sawmill--

                                     KATHERINE
                         And you don't know the first thing 
                         about this sawmill, that's why I'm 
                         running it--

                                     GIOVANNA
                         I haven't exercised this authority 
                         before but maybe I should have--

                                     KATHERINE
                         You're not shutting us down!

                                     GIOVANNA
                              (with surprising 
                              firmness)
                         No! I have the final say-so. Pete, 
                         push the plug!

                                     KATHERINE
                         Pete, don't you dare!

               Pete considers for a moment, then pushes some large buttons 
               and throws some switches. Katherine storms off.

                                                                    

               A STEAM WHISTLE

               As it screeches, signaling a work stoppage.

                                                                    

               THE SAWS

               As the power is cut end they grind to a halt.

                                                                    

                SAWMILL - DAY

               Janek enters the State Trooper's car, the Trooper closes the 
               passenger door, gets in on the driver's side and drives off, 
               siren wailing.

                                                                    

                SAWMILL OFFICE - DAY

               Giovanna flips a switch activating the mill's antiquated 
               public address system and speaks into a large, silver 
               microphone.

                                     GIOVANNA
                              (Italian accented, 
                              slightly fractured 
                              English)
                         Thank you, may I have your 
                         attention... this is "Jo" Packard...

                                                                  

               THROUGHOUT THE MILL

               The faces of the WORKERS are turned up towards the office 
               and the speakers.

                                     GIOVANNA
                         This morning, as you know, the body 
                         of Miss Laura Palmer was found near 
                         our dock. Just now your friend and 
                         co-worker Mr. Janek Pulaski has 
                         learned that his daughter Sharon, 
                         one of Laura's schoolmates, is missing 
                         since last night... I suffered the 
                         loss of someone dear to me not long 
                         ago and when my husband, Andrew, 
                         died the kind words and feelings 
                         that you expressed to me helped me 
                         so much. You are very kind people. I 
                         have decided that today, in the lights 
                         of what has happened, all work here 
                         will stop, the Mill will shut down. 
                         Perhaps you will spend the day with 
                         your families and once again you can 
                         all extend your good wishes to the 
                         Pulaskis and to the Palmers.
                              (pause)
                         Thank you all for your attention.

               Silence throughout the mill.

                                                                    

               KATHERINE

               In a hallway, listening to Giovanna on one of the loud 
               speakers.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (to the speaker)
                         Bitch!

               She turns and sees startled MILL WORKER standing behind her, 
               hat in hand.

                                     KATHERINE
                         What's you name?

                                     WORKER
                         Fred Truax.

                                     KATHERINE
                         You're fired!

               She storms off.

                                                                    

                HIGHWAY "21" - DAY

               An empty road. Silence, suddenly broken by James Hurley, on 
               his motorcycle, cutting through the wind with reckless 
               abandon.

                                                                    

                ED HURLEY'S GAS STATION - DAY

               James drives the bike off the highway, into the station and 
               pulls up next to the pumps. Without a glance at the office, 
               he screws off the cap and starts filling the bike's gas tank.

               ED HURLEY, James' uncle, a thin, taciturn man of forty, steps 
               out of the office and walks out to James as he tops off his 
               tank and hangs up the nozzle. Mindful of his state, Ed waits 
               for James to speak.

                                     JAMES
                         Laura's dead.

                                     ED
                         I heard.

               With restrained emotion, Ed puts a hand on James' shoulder. 
               James inhales deeply, choking back his feelings. Looks at 
               his Uncle. Looks away.

                                     JAMES
                         She was the one.

                                     ED
                              (nods, waits)
                         Buy you a cup a coffee?

               Pause.

                                     JAMES
                         'Can't do it.

               Before he's overcome with pain, James takes out a folded 
               note, hands it to Ed.

                                     JAMES
                         If Donna comes by, would you give 
                         this to her?

                                     ED
                         You bet.

               James hops on the bike, kicks it to life and roars off. Ed 
               watches him go. The door to the office opens and Ed's wife, 
               NADINE, a small, angry woman, wearing a black patch over her 
               left eye, calls out at him.

                                     NADINE
                         Ed? They said those drapes'd be ready 
                         by ten; now I want those drapes up 
                         by nightfall.

               Ed exhales heavily, waves at her without looking at her and 
               heads for his pick-up, parked nearby.

                                                                    

                REMOTE MOUNTAINOUS TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

               A eighteen-wheel logging truck with a full load barrels along, 
               downshifting to brake its speed on the steep decline.

                                                                    

                WOODS - DAY

               A rustling in a dark thicket. Bloodied bare feet stumbling 
               aimlessly town a slope.

                                                                    

                LOGGING TRUCK CAB - DAY

               As the DRIVER muscles his cab around a horseshoe bend, he 
               sees someone step out onto the road a few hundred feet ahead. 
               The Driver steps on the brakes and downshifts frantically. 
               The engine whines in protest.

                                                                    

               THE WHEELS

               Of the big rig screech along the blacktop, burning and 
               smoking.

                                                                    

               THE DRIVER'S POV

               Through the windshield, as the truck closes rapidly on the 
               missing high school girl, SHARON PULASKI, standing in the 
               middle of the road, dazed, helpless, bruised and cut, wearing 
               only bra and panties.

                                                                    

               THE TRUCK

               Finally lurches to a halt only a few inches from Sharon. Her 
               lost, brutalized face opens into a silent scream.

                HOSPITAL INTENSIVE CARE - DAY

               Sharon Pulaski lies in a hospital bed, attached by various 
               tubes to life-support machines and monitors. A Nurse fluffs 
               a pillow under her head, as another fits an oxygen tube to 
               her nostril.

                                                                    

               GROUP OF TRACKING DOGS

               Barking, restless, anxious to follow a scent. They're on the 
               highway, where Sharon came out of the woods. The logging 
               truck is pulled off the road, the Driver is talking to Andy 
               Brennan, who's filling out a report.

               Deputy Bernie Hill drives up in a cruiser, exits, carrying a 
               plastic evidence bag containing the clothes Sharon was 
               wearing. He takes them over to the dog's HANDLERS. The 
               Handlers open the bag and give the dog's the scent.

               A number of Deputies and CIVILIAN VOLUNTEERS follow the dogs, 
               as they pick up the trail and strain at their leashes, 
               bounding up the hill into the woods.

                                                               

                HIGHWAY - DAY

               A nondescript, government-issue, tan sedan drives up towards 
               Twin Peaks. Passes a sign that reads:

                        "WELCOME TO TWIN PEAKS. POPULATION 51,201"

                                                                    

                SEDAN - DAY

               Behind the wheel is FBI field agent DALE COOPER, mid-thirties, 
               handsome in an unremarkable way. He activates and speaks 
               into a microphone attached to his lapel, connected to a small, 
               Walkman-sized tape recorder clipped to his belt.

                                     COOPER
                         Diane, 2:15 in the afternoon, November 
                         14. Entering town of Twin Peaks. 
                         Five miles south of the Canadian 
                         border, twelve miles west of the 
                         state line. Never seen so many trees 
                         in my life. As W.C. Fields would 
                         say, I'd rather be here than 
                         Philadelphia. It's 54 degrees on a 
                         beautiful sunny afternoon. Weatherman 
                         said rain. If you could get paid 
                         that kind of money for being wrong 
                         60% of the time it'd beat working. 
                         Mileage is 79,345, gauge is on 
                         reserve, I'm riding on fumes, have 
                         to tank up when I get into town, 
                         remind me to tell you how much that 
                         is. Lunch was $6.31 and I left her a 
                         dollar tip, at the...
                              (digs out a restaurant 
                              receipt)
                         ...Lamplighter Inn, that's on Highway 
                         2 near Lewis Fork. That was a tuna 
                         fish sandwich on whole wheat and a 
                         slice of cherry pie and coffee. Darn 
                         good food. And if you ever get up 
                         this way, Diane, that cherry pie is 
                         worth a stop. Okay.
                              (looks for his notes)
                         I'll be looking for a...
                              (reads)
                         ...Sheriff Daniel Steadman, he's 
                         going to be at the Calhoun Memorial 
                         Hospital with that girl they pulled 
                         off the mountain. I'll be checking 
                         into a motel after we're through 
                         there. Sure the Sheriff'll be able 
                         to recommend a clean place. Reasonably 
                         priced.

               Turns off the microphone. Turns it back on again.

                                     COOPER
                         Forgot to mention. I stopped for 
                         coffee and a pit stop about 10:30, 
                         little diner near Bitteroot Lake. 
                         Excellent coffee. Forgot to get the 
                         receipt, can you believe it? That 
                         was seventy five cents and I left a 
                         quarter on the counter. Got to find 
                         out what kind of trees these are. 
                         They're really something.

               Turns off the microphone. Whistles "Rhapsody in Blue."

                                                                    

                CALHOUN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY

               In long shot, we see Dale Cooper drive up, get out of the 
               car where he's greeted by Sheriff Steadman and together they 
               enter the hospital.

                                                                    

                HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

               Steadman and Cooper walk down the corridor.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Sure glad to have you here. Kind'a 
                         lucky, in a way, Sharon stepped out 
                         across the state line. Whole town's 
                         really badly shaken up--

                                     COOPER
                         Sure it is, nice, quiet place, 
                         something like this. Let me stop you 
                         right here in the hallway for second, 
                         Sheriff.
                              (they stop; matter of 
                              factly)
                         There a few things we ought to get 
                         straight right off the bat. I've 
                         learned this the hard way and it's 
                         better to talk it out up front. When 
                         the Bureau gets called in, the 
                         Bureau's in charge. You're going to 
                         be working for me and sometimes local 
                         law enforcement has a problem with 
                         that. Hope you understand.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Like I said, we're glad to have you.

                                     COOPER
                         And what kind of fantastic trees 
                         have you got growing all around the 
                         area? Big, majestic--

                                     STEADMAN
                         Ponderosa pine.

                                     COOPER
                              (savors the sound)
                         "Ponderosa Pine."
                              (stars walking again)
                         Can somebody get me your coroner's 
                         report on the dead girl while we're 
                         in with the witness?

                                     STEADMAN
                         'Haven't done the autopsy yet. We 
                         can go downstairs to the morgue when 
                         we're done here.

                                     COOPER
                         Fine. What've we got from Sharon so 
                         far?

                                     STEADMAN
                         She hasn't said word one since we 
                         found her.

               They enter an office, past a stationed POLICEMAN. Janek and 
               his wife, MARIA PULASKI, and two of their other CHILDREN sit 
               on a bench by the door.

                                                                    

                INTENSIVE CARE - DAY

               Sharon Pulaski lies in bed, an IV in her arm, hooked up to 
               monitors, attended by two NURSES. Steadman and Cooper enter. 
               Seeing them, the attending physician, an attractive woman, 
               DR. SHELVY, moves towards them from the bed.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Dr. Shelvy, this is FBI Agent Dale 
                         Cooper.

                                     SHELVY
                         Glad to know you.

                                     COOPER
                         Doctor. How's the girl?

                                     SHELVY
                         She's in shock. Suffering from 
                         exposure.

                                     COOPER
                         Was she raped?

                                     SHELVY
                         Yes. More than once.

                                     COOPER
                         One perpetrator?

                                     SHELVY
                         Waiting for the tests.

                                     COOPER
                              (to Steadman)
                         Any connection to the murdered girl?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Same high school. Far as we know 
                         they hardly knew each other.
                              (shrugs)
                         No connection.

                                     COOPER
                         Can I question her?

                                     SHELVY
                         This girl doesn't even know where 
                         she is. Or if she is.

                                     COOPER
                         What are you saying?

                                     SHELVY
                         We need a CAT scan and we aren't 
                         equipped for that. My opinion is 
                         there may be neurological damage. 
                         She's just not responsive at all.

                                     COOPER
                         I'd like to look at her fingers.

               Shelvy and Steadman look at each other.

                                     SHELVY
                         All right.

               Cooper moves to Sharon. Her eyes are open, looking up at the 
               ceiling, moving restlessly. Cooper picks up left hand, looks 
               closely at the wrists, sees the distinctive wounds and a 
               look of intense interest comes over him. He immediately looks 
               very closely at her fingernails.

                                     STEADMAN
                         We already scraped for particles.

                                     COOPER
                         That's not what I'm looking for.
                              (looks closely, almost 
                              to himself)
                         Nothing here... not a thing...

                                     SHARON
                              (a sort of drugged, 
                              horrified whine)
                         Don't go there...

                                     SHELVY
                              (moving quickly to 
                              her side)
                         Sharon?

                                     COOPER
                         Sharon?

               Sharon almost seems to focus on them for a moment. A single 
               tear runs from her eye.

                                                                    

                ELEVATOR - DAY

               We see the floor indicator numbers light up, going down as 
               the elevator descends. Steadman and Cooper ride down, along 
               with a ONE-ARMED MAN. The door opens on the first floor. We 
               notice a MAN talking to a NURSE, seated behind a desk, eating 
               her lunch off a cafeteria tray. She laughs uneasily at 
               something the Man says. The One-Armed Man exits. The elevator 
               doors close.

               The elevator descends to the basement. The doors open. 
               Steadman and Cooper exit.

                                                                    

                MORGUE EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

               Bright overhead lights pop on, momentarily blinding us. A 
               low, vibratory throb of humming machinery. Steadman and Cooper 
               and a MORGUE ATTENDANT walk to a stainless steel examination 
               table in the middle of the white-tiled room.

               Laura Palmer's body lies on the table, covered by a shroud 
               of cloudy plastic. Cooper takes her left arm out from under 
               the cover and examines her fingers.

                                     STEADMAN
                         We did scrape the nails when she 
                         came in.

                                     COOPER
                              (sees something under 
                              the nail of her ring 
                              finger; energized)
                         There it is. Here it is. Oh my God, 
                         there it is.

                                     STEADMAN
                         What?

                                     COOPER
                              (to the Morgue 
                              Attendant)
                         Leave us alone please.

               The Attendant looks at Steadman. He nods. The Attendant exits.

                                     COOPER
                              (pointing to her nail)
                         Sheriff, I need something to grab 
                         onto this.

               Steadman uncovers and rummages through an autopsy tool tray, 
               finds and hands Cooper a pair of fine tweezers. Cooper 
               separates the nail from the finger, works the tweezers in 
               and dislodges a small, white speck from under the nail onto 
               a stainless steel tray.

               Cooper turns on his microphone, swings a mounted magnifying 
               glass over the tray, pulls it down over the speck and turns 
               on its attached light.

                                     COOPER
                         3:27 PM. Diane, Twin Peaks County 
                         Morgue. With the body of the victim... 
                         what's her name?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Laura Palmer.

                                     COOPER
                         Laura Palmer. Got here before the 
                         autopsy. It's the same thing, Diane, 
                         told you I had a feeling we'd see 
                         this again

                                     STEADMAN
                         What've you got there?

                                     COOPER
                         Ring finger. Under the nail. Let's 
                         see what he left us.

                                                                    

               THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS

               Using the tweezers, Cooper turns over the speck and we see 
               printed on the tiny piece of white paper is the letter "R" .

                                     COOPER
                         It's an "r". Diane, let's give this 
                         to Albert and his team, don't go to 
                         Sam, Albert seems to have a little 
                         more on the ball.

               RESUME SCENE

               As Cooper turns off the mic and turns to Steadman.

                                     COOPER
                         Need to bag and tag this.

                                     STEADMAN
                         You gonna let me in on whatever the 
                         hell's going on here?

                                     COOPER
                         Sheriff, we've got a lot to talk 
                         about.

                                                                    

                BACK OF ROADHOUSE - DAY

               Donna Hayward drives up in a Mercedes-Benz station wagon and 
               parks behind the Roadhouse Nightclub, near a couple of 
               motorcycles, in front of a large, wooden shed. On the roof 
               of the shed is an erector-set-like oil derrick-shaped 
               structure, supporting a small, blue neon sign that reads:

                                      "HEMINGWAY'S"

               Donna goes up the steps to the door, knocks and enters.

                                                                    

                HEMINGWAY'S - DAY

               A sparsely furnished coffee house. Two walls with shelves 
               packed with books. On the wall behind a small raised platform 
               is a large, black and white photograph of Ernest Hemingway. 
               Two BIKERS in black leather sit at one of the tables, reading 
               books. JAKE MORISSEY, the large, friendly owner of the 
               Roadhouse and "Hemingway's", wearing an apron, is cleaning 
               an unique brass Espresso machine.

                                     DONNA
                         Is James around?

                                     JAKE
                         He was. You just missed him.

                                     DONNA
                         Thanks.

               Donna exits.

                                                               

                ED HURLEY'S GAS STATION - DAY

               The Mercedes-Benz station wagon is parked across the highway 
               from the gas station.

                                                                    

                MERCEDES-BENZ STATION WAGON - DAY

               Donna Hayward sits in the driver's seat, the engine running, 
               listening to the radio, a Golden Oldies station, watching 
               the road.

                                                                    

               HER POV

               As Ed Hurley drives up in his pick-up, turns into the station 
               parking lot and parks.

                                                                    

               DONNA

               Puts the car in gear, drives across the highway into the 
               station and pulls up next to Ed's pick-up.

                                                                    

               THE BED OF THE PICK-UP

               Inside is a large, wrapped package with a label that reads, 
               "GENTLE JIM'S DRAPES." Ed turns from the truck bed, as he 
               sees Donna get out of her car and approach him.

                                     DONNA
                         Hi, Ed.

                                     ED
                         Hey, Donna.

               He sees she's about to burst into tears, opens his arms and 
               embraces her. She weeps.

                                     ED
                         I'm so sorry...

               She nods, starts to regain her composure.

                                     DONNA
                         Have you seen James?

                                     ED
                         He came by.

                                     DONNA
                         Is he okay?

                                     ED
                         No.

                                     DONNA
                         You know where he went? He wasn't up 
                         at "Hemingway's."

                                     ED
                         I don't know. But he said to to give 
                         this to you.

               He hands her a folded note. Donna opens it. It reads:

                           "21 BILLIARDS. SEE JOEY AFTER NINE."

               Out on the highway, a white 1959 Chevy Impala slams on its 
               brakes, hits the horn, the driver does a squealing U-turn to 
               pull into the gas station parking lot and stops near Donna 
               and Ed. Mike Nelson, Bobby's friend, is driving the car. He 
               leans out the window.

                                     MIKE
                              (furious; to Donna)
                         Hey! What the hell are you doin' 
                         here?

                                     DONNA
                         I--

                                     MIKE
                         We've been lookin' all over for you! 
                         In case you didn't know it, Bobby's 
                         in a lot of trouble! He's my best 
                         friend, you're supposed to be with 
                         me and we're goin' down to the police 
                         station to be with him!

                                     DONNA
                         Don't tell me where I ought'a be--
                         and by the way, Laura was my best 
                         friend--

                                     MIKE
                         Get in the car!

                                     ED
                              (he's heard enough)
                         Muffle it there, Junior.

                                     MIKE
                         Mind your own business!

                                     ED
                         You're on my lot, friend.

                                     MIKE
                         Not for long! Donna, you get to the 
                         Sheriff's right now!

               Mike guns it and digs out in the loose gravel, fishtailing 
               onto the highway. Donna's trembling with anger and 
               frustration.

                                     DONNA
                         Boy, do I know how to pick 'em.

               Nadine throws open a window in their apartment above the 
               garage and calls out.

                                     NADINE
                         Ed! You waitin' for those drapes to 
                         hang themselves?!

                                     ED
                              (waves dismissively 
                              at her; to Donna)
                         I know how to pick 'em too.

               They both manage a small smile. Donna heads for her car.

                                     DONNA
                         If you see James, tell him I'm looking 
                         for him.

                                     ED
                         You bet. Take it easy now, Donna.

                                                                    

                SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

               Re-establish.

                                                                    

                EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY

               Steadman and Dale Cooper are seated at a table, examining 
               the box of evidence that was taken from Laura Palmer's 
               bedroom. Steadman takes a video cassette out of the box.

                                     COOPER
                         That's the tape you found in the 
                         video camera in Laura's room.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Right.

                                     COOPER
                         At a certain point I'm going to want 
                         to show that to the boyfriend.

                                     STEADMAN
                         You say when.

               Cooper puts on a pair of thin, rubber gloves and looks into 
               the box of Laura's belongings.

                                     COOPER
                         Did you complete all your forensics?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Yes.

               Cooper picks up Laura's locked diary.

                                     COOPER
                         No key yet, huh?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Still looking.

               Cooper casually snaps open the lock, opens the diary and 
               uses an orange stick to turn to the last entries. He activates 
               his tape recorder.

                                     COOPER
                         Diane, I've just opened Laura Palmer's 
                         diary. This is the last entry, dated 
                         yesterday, November 13...
                              (reads)
                         "Cloudy. Sort of giddy. Not even 
                         cautiously optimistic. Day Eighteen. 
                         Eight o'clock. Asparagus for dinner 
                         again. I hate asparagus. Does this 
                         mean I'll never grow up"... then 
                         she's written...
                              (counts)
                         ...nine questions marks... "Nervous 
                         about meeting 'J' tonight." That's 
                         the last entry.
                              (to Steadman)
                         That's something to get started on.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (writing down the 
                              letter "J")
                         One out of twenty-six.

               Cooper turns back a few pages and reads again.

                                     COOPER
                         Day fourteen. Indian summer. Picnic 
                         at Le Sparkwood Cafe--al fresco. Am 
                         I this happy?"

                                                                  :

               THE DIARY

               As Cooper continues to thumb back through the pages, he finds 
               a small key inside a small, slit glassine envelope, taped to 
               a page.

                                     COOPER
                              (instant recognition)
                         Diane. I just turned back eighteen 
                         days; it says here, "Day One." What 
                         we've got taped to the page here is 
                         a glassine envelope containing a 
                         white residue and what looks to be a 
                         key to a...
                              (thinks, places it)
                         ...safety deposit box.
                              (closely examines 
                              envelope)
                         Sheriff, after you very carefully 
                         remove this key, we're going to run 
                         this envelope and my bet is it'll 
                         test positive for cocaine.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (indignantly)
                         That's impossible--

                                     COOPER
                         You ever been surprised before?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Mr. Cooper, you didn't know Laura 
                         Palmer--

                                     COOPER
                         Benefit of the doubt, innocent until 
                         proven guilty, but that's still 
                         cocaine in that envelope.

               Holds out the envelope. Steadman takes it.

                                     COOPER
                         Get started on a court order to open 
                         her deposit box and maybe we'll both 
                         find out a few things about Laura 
                         Palmer.

               Steadman exits. Cooper reaches into the box again.

                                     COOPER
                         Diane, I'm holding in my hand a box 
                         of small, chocolate bunnies...

                                                                    

                POLICE STATION HOLDING CELL - DAY

               A despondent Bobby Briggs sits at a table with his parents, 
               Bette and Major Briggs. Across from them is Bobby's lawyer, 
               a short, rotund, silver-throated man by the name of GILMAN 
               WHITE. A DEPUTY enters to announce...

                                     DEPUTY
                         We're ready for you.

               He waits to escort them out.

                                     GILMAN
                              (instructing Bobby)
                         Now Bobby, remember what I told you; 
                         the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
                         does not appreciate smart talk. You 
                         answer their questions, openly and 
                         honesty. If you're having any trouble, 
                         any strange feelings, any questions, 
                         you consult with me, that's why I'm 
                         here. If there are any questions I 
                         would prefer that you not answer 
                         directly, I will so signal you. Is 
                         that understood?

               Bobby nods sullenly.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         What do you say to Mr. White, Robert?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yes, sir.

               The Deputy moves to Bobby. Bobby rises and walks out with 
               him. White picks up his briefcase and follows.

                                                                    

                INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

               Steadman and Cooper enter and take seats across the table 
               from Bobby and Gilman White. There is a TV and VCR on a stand 
               in the corner.

                                     COOPER
                              (right to the point)
                         Bobby, did you kill Laura Palmer?

                                     BOBBY
                         No!

                                     COOPER
                              (writes something on 
                              a piece of paper)
                         She was studying at your house until 
                         about nine thirty last night, isn't 
                         that right?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yeah.
                              (looks at Gilman)
                         Yes, sir.

               Cooper shows Steadman the piece of paper: on it he's written, 
               "He didn't do it." Steadman is nonplusses.

                                     COOPER
                         She drive herself home?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yes.

                                     COOPER
                         You had a big fight with her last 
                         week, didn't you?

                                     BOBBY
                         So what?

               Gilman puts a hand on Bobby's arm.

                                     BOBBY
                         If I had a fight with her, if I sang 
                         songs with her, if I went skipping 
                         rope with her what difference does 
                         it make? I didn't kill her.

                                     COOPER
                         Bobby, here's how this works, we ask 
                         questions and you answer only the 
                         questions that we ask. Briefly and 
                         to the po

               Cooper picks up a remote control and turns on the VCR in the 
               corner. A picture appears on the monitor.

                                                                  :

               THE MONITOR

               A slightly fuzzy picture: Donna and Laura in a sunlit forest 
               glade, having a Indian summer picnic on a red and white 
               checked blanket, blanket and mugging for the handheld video 
               camera. We don't see or hear the camera operator.

                                     COOPER
                              (watching Bobby 
                              carefully)
                         Did you shoot this video, Bobby?

               A cold, jealous rage rises in Bobby as he watches the girls 
               laughing, seeing only Laura and her happiness.

                                     BOBBY
                         No.

                                     COOPER
                         If you didn't take them, who did? 
                         Did you know that Laura was seeing 
                         someone else?
                              (no answer)
                         That's what you fought about last 
                         week, isn't it, Bobby? Look at these 
                         pictures, look how happy she is.
                              (no answer)
                         'You ever take cocaine with Laura?

                                     BOBBY
                              (shocked)
                         I never did that!

                                     GILMAN
                         Excuse me but what are you charging 
                         my client with?

                                     COOPER
                              (smiles, as he writes 
                              again)
                         That's right, you're a football 
                         player, aren't you, Bobby?

               He shows Steadman the pad; on it he's written: "Kid's a lousy 
               liar."

                                     COOPER
                         If you knew who she was seeing, trust 
                         me on this, now's the time to tell 
                         us.

                                     BOBBY
                         Why don't you ask Donna? She was 
                         there with 'em!

                                     COOPER
                         I'm asking you, Bobby. Give me a 
                         name. Here's a clue. First initial 
                         "J."

               Bobby can't, or won't, come up with a name.

                                     BOBBY
                              (almost to himself)
                         "J"...
                              (self-pitying)
                         She wouldn't. She wouldn't'a done 
                         that to me.
                              (almost mumbling)
                         I can't believe it. I can't believe 
                         it...

                                     COOPER
                              (as he rises)
                         You didn't love her anyway.
                              (to Steadman)
                         Let him go.

               Cooper exits. Steadman tries to give the appearance of keeping 
               up.

                                                                    

                SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

               Cooper exits the interrogation room. He looks towards the 
               desk and sees Donna speaking to Lucy, the dispatcher. Mike 
               is standing sullenly nearby. Cooper makes a bee-line for 
               Donna.

                                     COOPER
                         Donna?
                              (she looks up at him)
                         You and I are going to have a little 
                         talk about a picnic.

               Donna looks at Cooper, then at Mike.

                                                                    

                MOUNTAIN SIDE FOREST - DAY

               A TRACKER is holding back two of his dogs, who are barking 
               furiously at the mouth of a hillside cave. A Trooper stands 
               by with his gun drawn.

               Deeply shaken, Deputy Andy Brennan exits the cave a moment 
               later, holding a flashlight and his gun. He absent-mindedly 
               walks past the others and they watch him drift into the woods.

                                                                    

                THE WOODS - DAY

               Andy slumps down onto a rock. Sets down his pistol and takes 
               out his handi-talk radio and, with difficulty, activates it. 
               His gun slides off the rock into the dirt.

                                     ANDY
                              (shaking)
                         Lucy... Lucy...

                                                                  :

                SHERIFF'S OFFICE SWITCHBOARD - DAY

               Lucy, at the switchboard, speaks over her headset.

                                     LUCY
                         Andy, is that you?... I can hardly 
                         hear you...

                                     ANDY
                         Tell Dan, we found where... it 
                         happened... Ghostwood Forest, about 
                         three miles east of the highway... 
                         tell Dan...
                              (he can't continue)

                                     LUCY
                              (quietly, tenderly)
                         Andy, are you okay? Sweetie?

                                     ANDY
                         I didn't cry... but Lucy... it's 
                         horrible... oh, God...

               He can't fight it. He starts to cry.

                SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

               Steadman backs his four-wheel vehicle up to the back door, 
               throws open the rear gate and goes into an open equipment 
               room.

                                                                    

                SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

               Cooper guides Donna into the interrogation room and closes 
               the door. Cooper studies her.

                         Have a seat, Donna.

                                                                    

                SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

               Bobby's parents and Gilman White are talking near the exit, 
               as Bobby is released by a Deputy from the holding cell area. 
               Bobby looks at his parents, then sees Mike waiting by a water 
               cooler near the front desk, where Lucy is typing. Bobby walks 
               over to Mike.

                                     MIKE
                         Hey, buddy.

                                     BOBBY
                         Hey, Snake, we're outta here.

                                     MIKE
                         Just a sec', Donna's in there.

                                     BOBBY
                              (low and angry)
                         You straightened her out yet?

                                     MIKE
                         I don't know what's up with her, 
                         man.

                                     BOBBY
                         Forget her. I got it figured. Laura 
                         and her. We're lookin' at some 
                         freakin' biker. And some freakin' 
                         biker is gonna get his head busted 
                         open.

                                     MIKE
                         Who is it?

               Lucy pauses in her typing and slightly turns her head towards 
               them. Bobby picks up on it.

                                     BOBBY
                         Come out here.

               They head for the exit, passing his parents and lawyer.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                              (formal but sympathetic)
                         Robert, I'll be at home this evening 
                         if you need a sympathetic ear.

                                     BOBBY
                         I don't need any damn sympathetic 
                         anything.

               Bobby and Mike leave the building.

                                                                    

                INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

               Cooper and Donna, his questioning in progress.

                                     COOPER
                         You mean to tell me you and Laura 
                         went on this picnic alone, just the 
                         two of you?

                                     DONNA
                         What's wrong with that?

                                     COOPER
                         Deep into the woods, not another 
                         soul around--

                                     DONNA
                         Is there some law against having a 
                         picnic?

                                     COOPER
                         Donna, this is interesting to me, 
                         because with just the two of you out 
                         there--

               He turns on the VCR with the remote and we see the video of 
               the picnic.

                                     COOPER
                         I can't for the life of me figure 
                         out how these pictures got taken.

               Donna, feeling trapped and frightened, thinks fast.

                                     DONNA
                         Oh. Oh, that. That's easy. There was 
                         a hiker, came along with a backpack 
                         and we asked her to take the pictures.

                                     COOPER
                         What was her name?

                                     DONNA
                         I don't think we ever asked her. Or 
                         I forget. Maybe we did, I don't 
                         remember.

                                     COOPER
                              (non-threatening)
                         Donna... who are you protecting?

                                     DONNA
                         Nobody. That's what really happened.

                                     COOPER
                         Does the person's name start with 
                         the letter "J"?

                                     DONNA
                              (blushing)
                         I told you, she didn't tell us her 
                         name.

                                     COOPER
                         Donna, this is serious business. 
                         More serious than a girl falling in 
                         love with someone other than her 
                         boyfriend. Much more serious than 
                         you know.

               Donna remains silent. We hear a beep, an intercom on the 
               desk activating.

                                     LUCY'S VOICE
                         Agent Cooper, the Sheriff's ready to 
                         roll up to the site and I've got 
                         something else for you here.

                                     COOPER
                              (into the speaker)
                         You can come on in.
                              (to Donna)
                         I know Laura was your best friend. 
                         You've been through a lot today. 
                         We're finished here--for the time 
                         being.

               Donna rises. She exits. Steadman and Lucy enter.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Tell Agent Cooper what you heard 
                         Lucy.

                                     LUCY
                         Okay. Now, after you were done with 
                         Bobby? And he was taken back to his 
                         cell? Well, then his parents were 
                         standing by the door, with his lawyer, 
                         and Bobby, he was released and he 
                         came out and he saw his friend Mike, 
                         who was down by the water cooler, 
                         which is near my desk--

                                     COOPER
                         Uh-huh, uh-huh--

                                     LUCY
                         Okay, okay. Well, I pretended to be 
                         typing but I was typing what Mike 
                         and Bobby were saying, well they 
                         didn't say exactly who it was that 
                         they were talking about but anyway 
                         here's what they were saying--

               She offers him a typed page. He doesn't take it

                                     COOPER
                         They said the guy we're looking for 
                         is a biker.

                                     LUCY
                              (crestfallen)
                         Yeah...

                                     STEADMAN
                              (amazed again)
                         Yeah.

               Cooper turns on the VCR with the remote, fast forwards the 
               picture, then lets it run at normal speed until Donna moves 
               up extremely close to the lens. He freezes the frame and 
               points to a partial reflection of a motorcycle in the pupil 
               of her eye.

                                                                    

                MOUNTAIN OVERLOOK - DAY

               A motorcycle is parked on a high crest, overlooking a wooded 
               valley and the town in the deep background. We hear the sound 
               of SIRENS wailing in the distance.

               James Hurley sits on a rock. His eyes red, his face torn 
               with grief. He holds a small envelope in one hand. His other 
               hand holds something protectively in a closed fist.

                                                                    

               HIS HAND

               As it opens and we see he's holding a gold necklace in the 
               shape of half of a heart. He rubs it lovingly and closes his 
               hand again.

                MOUNTAINSIDE CAVE - DAY

               In the darkness, we see a powerful beam of light sweep slowly 
               across the walls, revealing random patterns of spayed blood. 
               The light follows the trail of the blood across a dirt floor 
               and up a raised mound of blood-saturated dirt.

               On top of the mound is the other half of the heart-shaped 
               gold necklace and just below it a folded piece of paper. 
               Something is written on the paper in what could be blood.

               We see it is Dale Cooper holding the flashlight. Behind him 
               are Steadman and some other officers. Cooper reaches in with 
               a gloved hand, gently turns over the note and reads...

                                   FIRE. WALK WITH ME.

                                                                    

               A TV SET

               On the monitor is a news report showing location video footage 
               of Cooper, Steadman and the other officers emerging from the 
               mountainside cave.

                                     LOCAL REPORTER
                              (voice-over)
                         ...from what is believed to be where 
                         the brutal slaying of Laura Palmer 
                         occurred. And tonight, Sharon 
                         Pulaski...

               We see a high-school yearbook picture of Sharon.

                                     LOCAL REPORTER
                         ...the second intended victim, who 
                         apparently escaped her captor and 
                         fled to safety, remains hospitalized 
                         in critical condition at Calhoun 
                         Memorial...

               During above we pull back to discover we're in a cheaply 
               panelled and furnished living room.

                                                                    

               SHELLY SIMPSON

               The Double "R" Diner waitress, wearing a bathrobe and smoking 
               a cigarette, is watching the set in her living room. She 
               flicks her cigarette into the ashtray, unable to take her 
               eyes off the set.

               Her husband, LEO JOHNSON, a lanky, sinewy, pallid man of 
               thirty, pomaded hair, wearing a torn t-shirt, dirty jeans 
               and white socks, his heavy boots nearby on the floor. He 
               holds an open bottle of creme de menthe.

                                     SHELLY
                         Lord, I can't believe it. I can't 
                         believe it.

               Leo has not taken his eyes off the ashtray.

                                                                    

               LEO'S POV - THE ASHTRAY

               Filled with butts. Two different brands.

                                                                    

               RESUME SCENE

               Leo continued to look at the ashtray.

                                     LEO
                              (politely)
                         Shelly... turn off the TV.

                                     SHELLY
                         Why? Why? I went to see this--

               She turns to him. Sees the look on his face. Gets up 
               immediately and turns off the television.

                                     LEO
                         Shelly, sit down here a minute and 
                         help me out.

               She sits obediently. He still hasn't looked at her.

                                     LEO
                         What kind of cigarettes do you smoke?

                                     SHELLY
                         Whatever's around.

                                     LEO
                         No you don't.
                              (he picks up a butt 
                              from the ashtray)
                         You smoke these.
                              (he picks up a 
                              different brand butt)
                         What are these doing here?

                                     SHELLY
                         Come on, Leo, I get different packs 
                         at the diner. Me and Norma.

               Pause.

                         There's two things, Shelly. First, 
                         this house should be cleaned up for 
                         me when I come home... I mean clean.

                                     SHELLY
                         Okay--

               He holds up a hand and silences her instantly.

                                     LEO
                              (evenly)
                         Number two. You smoke one brand of 
                         cigarettes from now on. Because if I 
                         ever see two different brands of 
                         cigarettes in any ashtray in this 
                         house again, I'm gonna snap your 
                         neck like a twig.

               Trembling, he takes a big swig of creme de menthe and locks 
               eyes with her.

                                     SHELLY
                         You got nothing to worry about with 
                         me, darlin'.

               She forces a smile. He looks at her hard. Right through her.

                GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

               On a small TV monitor at the front desk, continuing the report 
               on the news about Laura. Watching are the DESK CLERK and the 
               group of Norwegians we saw earlier in the day, who are in 
               the process of checking out of the hotel. Two BELLMEN are 
               loading their baggage on a trolley.

                                     LOCAL REPORTER'S VOICE
                              (voice over, on the 
                              TV)
                         ...cheerleader, Homecoming Queen, 
                         most popular girl in school, friend 
                         to many in the community. Seventeen 
                         years old. Laura Palmer, found dead 
                         this morning, the victim of violent 
                         crime...

               During above, we see Benjamin Horne, the Translator, and 
               Sven Jorgenson, the group's leader, are standing beside a 
               nearby column, speaking in hushed, urgent tones.

                                     HORNE
                         --Mr. Jorgenson, I urge you to 
                         reconsider, I want to appeal to your 
                         best nature--

               The Translator tries to translate simultaneously and then 
               struggles to keep up with them both.

                                     SVEN
                              (over the translator)
                         Best nature? We have best nature at 
                         home; no violent crime, crime rate 
                         nothing--

                                     HORNE
                         It is a great injustice to judge our 
                         community by this horrible exception 
                         to the rule, I have a daughter myself, 
                         she's the same age, she goes to the 
                         same high school--

                                     SVEN
                         Everyone here have gun! Not good!

                                     HORNE
                         Sir, you are throwing away the 
                         investment opportunity of a lifetime--

                                     SVEN
                         Better that then to throw lifetime 
                         away--

                                     HORNE
                              (to the Translator)
                         You keep out of this!

                                                                    

                GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY

               We drift from the hotel over to "The Grange"; a large, 
               adjacent manor house, the private home of Benjamin Home.

                                                                    

                GRANGE - CLOSER ANGLE - DAY

               In an upstairs window, we see JOHNNY HORNE, Benjamin Horne's 
               twenty-seven year old son, standing alone, looking out over 
               the lawn. He turns away from the window.

                                                                    

                JOHNNY HORNE'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Johnny throws himself down to a sprawling position on the 
               floor and we see that the room is filled with large, expensive 
               toys. He begins to bang his head on a exquisite, doll house 
               replica of "The Grange" itself.

                                                                    

                GRANGE DOLL HOUSE - DAY

               With every impact, the furniture and small figurines inside 
               bounce violently up and down.

                                                                    

                GRANGE DINING ROOM - DAY

               SYLVIA HORNE, Johnny's mother, Benjamin's wife, and Audrey 
               Horne, her daughter, sit at the dining room table, having 
               tea from a sterling tea service. Strained silence. Audrey 
               stares at the heel of her black leather pump. Sylvia hears 
               approaching footsteps and presses a hand to her forehead in 
               exasperation. A NURSE enters the room.

                                     NURSE
                         Mrs. Horne, I think it might help if 
                         you'd talk to Johnny yourself--

                                     SYLVIA
                              (pained sarcasm)
                         Oh, you think it might help? You 
                         tell Johnny, one more time, that 
                         Laura is not coming to work with him 
                         this afternoon, tomorrow afternoon 
                         or any afternoon. What is so difficult 
                         to understand about that?

                                                                    

                ED HURLEY'S GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON

               A small television on a work bench is on, continuing the 
               news report. Ed is doing a lube job on a late model Oldsmobile 
               up on the rack. His wall phone rings. He walks over and picks 
               it up.

                                     ED
                         Ed's Garage, Ed speaking.

                                                                  :

                DOUBLE "R" DINER KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

               Norma, the bombshell waitress and diner owner, is on a wall 
               phone in the kitchen. The diner is humming with activity.

                                     NORMA
                              (hushed, urgent)
                         I know I promised not to call there, 
                         but I have to see you... I feel so 
                         bad, I can't tell you...

                                     ED
                         I know. It's okay.

               He reaches down, turns up the sound on the small television 
               and glances out the back window, up the small hill towards 
               his house.

                                                                    

               ED'S POV - HIS HOUSE

               In the big picture window of his living room, we see a new 
               set of drapes being closed, then opened, then closed, then 
               opened.

                                                                    

               RESUME SCENE

               Ed turns back to the phone.

                                     ED
                         I'll try to meet you at the Roadhouse, 
                         'round 9:30. He hangs up. Turns the 
                         sound on the tv back down.

                                                                    

                BANK - DAY

               The flag flies at half mast.

                                                                    

                BANK - DAY

               Cooper and Steadman are being lead into a back room by ALICE 
               BRADY, a uniformed bank guard. During below, she retrieves 
               Laura's safety deposit box.

                                     ALICE
                              (slightly hysterical)
                         I knew Laura she was always so nice--

                                     COOPER
                         When was the last time she came in?

                                     ALICE
                         Oh, I couldn't tell you exactly, 
                         there are so many boxes here--

                                     COOPER
                         You don't keep records.

                                     ALICE
                         Well we have plenty of paper work as 
                         it is, you know, with a town this 
                         size--

                                     COOPER
                         Can you tell me how long Laura has 
                         had the box?

                                     ALICE
                         I'd say about six months, I could 
                         check for you--

                                     COOPER
                         Would you please? And you can just 
                         give me the box, m'am, we'll take it 
                         from here.

               Cooper takes the box. He and Steadman enter a smaller, privacy 
               room. Cooper sets the box down and opens it with the key he 
               found in Laura's diary. He reaches inside and lifts out the 
               sole item in the box.

               A magazine entitled: "SEX TOYS: SWINGERS, COAST-TO-COAST."

                                     STEADMAN
                         Jesus...

               Just touching the edge of the pages, Cooper leafs through 
               the magazine. A thick, rubber-band wrapped packet of one 
               hundred dollar bills fall out.

                                     COOPER
                         Over ten grand. That's a lotta Girl 
                         Scout cookies.

               Cooper turns the magazine to a dog-eared page.

                                                                  :

               THE MAGAZINE

               Featuring ads and photographs of men and women, soliciting 
               various sexually-oriented responses. One of the ads is 
               circled. It is a burn-out, flashbulb photo of Sharon Pulaski, 
               in sex lingerie, a drugged glaze in her eyes.

                                     COOPER
                         There's your connection.

                                                                    

                TOWN SQUARE - EARLY EVENING

               Cooper and Steadman walk through the town square, past the 
               gazebo, towards city hall.

                                     COOPER
                              (stopping to look at 
                              the gazebo)
                         I've seen these in pictures before, 
                         but there is an actual gazebo, right 
                         here in your city square. That is 
                         beautiful.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (looks at his watch)
                         You know we're gonna be late for 
                         that meeting--

                                     COOPER
                              (continuing on)
                         You know, I'm from Philadelphia and 
                         a thing like this, a gazebo, in a 
                         town square that is so meticulously 
                         maintained.
                              (head snaps around, 
                              noticing another 
                              detail)
                         --look how these hedges are clipped.

               They head towards a side entrance in city hall. We MOVE to 
               PICK UP a group of REPORTERS, milling around between a few 
               television news crew trucks in front of city hall and STAY 
               WITH one REPORTER, taping a stand-up news report in front of 
               the hall's imposing mahogany doors.

                                     REPORTER
                         --I'm speaking to you tonight from 
                         in front of the Town Hall of Twin 
                         Peaks, where, just behind me, the 
                         City Council and Chamber of Commerce 
                         have called an emergency session to

                         rocked this remote, peaceful

                TOWN HALL AUDITORIUM - DAY

               On a raised dais, Dale Cooper watches the City Council and 
               Chamber of Commerce MEMBERS moving down the aisles, milling 
               about, taking their seats. Prominent among them is Benjamin 
               Horne. Seated near him are Katherine and Pete Martell. 
               Cooper's eye catches Giovanna Packard as she enters. He almost 
               does a double take. He leans over to Sheriff Steadman and 
               asks discreetly...

                                     COOPER
                         Who's the babe?

                                     STEADMAN
                         That's Mrs. Packard

                                     COOPER
                         Packard Sawmill?
                              (Steadman nods)
                         Where's Mr. Packard?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Died in a boating accident last year. 
                         Andrew Packard practically built 
                         this town. Brought her back from 
                         Italy four years ago. Left her 
                         everything. Which didn't exactly 
                         please Packard's sister.
                              (points to Katherine)
                         ...that's her over there. The original 
                         deep freeze.

                                     COOPER
                              (meaning Giovanna)
                         So rich and available. Bet there's a 
                         line outside her door.

               Benjamin Horne crosses to Giovanna, with a greeting of 
               unctuous sympathy.

                                     STEADMAN
                         My advice is, take a number.

                                     COOPER
                         I'm not big on crowds.
                              (seeing Horne)
                         Who's the glad-handing dandy?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Benjamin Horne. Local big-wig. Owns 
                         half the town. He's not after her, 
                         he's after her land.

               At the podium, with some considerable effort, DWAYNE MILFORD, 
               the frail, eighty-six year old Mayor of Twin Peaks, nearing 
               the end of his 23rd consecutive term, gavels the meeting to 
               order and speaks into the microphone.

                                     MILFORD
                              (shaking, nearly deaf)
                         Ladies and gentlemen, if I could 
                         have your attention...
                              (smacks the microphone)
                         ...is this thing on?! Is this thing 
                         on?!

               Steadman steps in beside Milford, pats him encouragingly on 
               the back and adjusts the microphone so Milford can speak 
               into it more directly.

                                     MILFORD
                         We have all today shared in the 
                         grief... the grief that flies to 
                         death. The tragic death of young 
                         Miss Palmer, so beautiful, so 
                         innocent. And this grief is attended 
                         by fear. Tonight it preoccupies us. 
                         And to help us assuage our fears, I 
                         give you Sheriff Steadman.

               He yields to Steadman, who first helps Milford to his seat.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Folks, I'll get right to the po 
                         Laura Palmer was brutally murdered. 
                         It looks like Sharon Pulaski barely 
                         escaped the same fate. When Sharon 
                         turned up across the state line, 
                         this became a matter for the FBI. 
                         And after hearing what Agent Dale 
                         Cooper had to tell me, I, for one, 
                         am grateful for his and the Bureau's 
                         help. I think you'll feel the same 
                         way. Agent Cooper?

               He yields the microphone to Dale Cooper.

                                     COOPER
                         Ladies and Gentlemen, Federal Bureau 
                         of Investigation, Special Agent Dale 
                         Cooper. Kidnapping. Rape. Murder. 
                         These are words you're fortunate 
                         enough not to hear very often in 
                         your town. I wish I could tell you 
                         that you won't hear them again. But 
                         these are the facts; one year ago, 
                         almost to the day, in a town in the 
                         southwest corner of this state, the 
                         body of a girl named Teresa Banks 
                         was found. She had no family, no one 
                         came forward to claim her body. It 
                         was hardly even news. Until today.
                              (a stir runs through 
                              the room)
                         There are irrefutable similarities 
                         that for obvious reasons I will not 
                         specify, that lead us to conclude 
                         that Laura Palmer is the second, and 
                         Sharon Pulaski would have been the 
                         third victim, of the same killer.
                              (the room is abuzz)
                         There is a chance that the person 
                         who committed these crimes is someone 
                         from this town, possibly even someone 
                         you know. You are the leaders of 
                         this community. It's vitally important 
                         that this not turn into a witch hunt. 
                         I would like to propose that you 
                         enact some specific measures to 
                         protect the innocent and bring the 
                         guilty to justice...

               He consults his notes.

                                     COOPER
                         I would propose a public service 
                         announcement over local media asking 
                         for any information regarding these 
                         crimes, with a hotline number, manned 
                         by volunteers or community-funded 
                         operators, to field and sort through 
                         these calls... an investigation like 
                         this can turn on the most seemingly 
                         insignificant piece of information. 
                         I would also strongly suggest that 
                         you impose a temporary curfew for 
                         those under eighteen years of age. 
                         Keeping your kids off the streets 
                         now will teach them a degree of 
                         caution that may protect them in the 
                         days and weeks to come. I will remind 
                         you that these crimes occurred at 
                         night.

                                                                    

                SPARKWOOD MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

               The sound of wind through the pines. An owl hoots.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

                                       

                                         ACT FIVE

               FADE IN:

                TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

               The gazebo in the empty square. Silence.

                                                                    

                INTERSECTION - NIGHT

               Where Sparkwood Road meets Highway "21", a traffic light 
               cycles from green to yellow to red. A cold wind sets the 
               light swinging.

                                                                    

                DOUBLE "R" DINER - NIGHT

               A few cars in the lot. The dinner crowd at the counter, 
               seeming to huddle together against the darkness.

                                                                    

                HIGHWAY "21" - NIGHT

               A group of motorcycle riders, the group we saw under credits, 
               glide by the Roadhouse in formation.

                                                                    

                THE HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT

               Warm lights in the windows against the cold night.

                                                                    

                HAYWARD HOUSE STAIRWELL - NIGHT

               Donna Hayward stands silently on the stairwell, eavesdropping 
               on a conversation in the living room below, between her father 
               Dr. Hayward and her mother, EILEEN HAYWARD, a beautiful, 
               pale women, early forties, confined to a wheel chair, a 
               blanket covering her paralyzed legs.

                                     HAYWARD
                              (quietly, 
                              confidentially)
                         --Leland held up all through the 
                         day, I don't know that I could have 
                         done the same--

                                     EILEEN
                         The poor dear... poor Sarah...

                                     HAYWARD
                         Eileen, the brutality... the madness 
                         of it...

                                     EILEEN
                         I know...
                              (reaches for his hand)

                                     HAYWARD
                         They're not releasing many details. 
                         Wisely, I think. At the scene, where 
                         it happened... no one else knows 
                         this... they found part of a necklace, 
                         Laura's necklace. Half of a golden 
                         heart. She was wearing it in a video 
                         they found... I'm telling you this 
                         for a reason; Donna was in that video 
                         with her... they don't know who shot 
                         the video or who else was with them... 
                         but they think the killer may have 
                         the other half of that heart...

               Alarmed, Donna starts to slowly creep back up the stairs, 
               undetected.

                                                                    

                HAYWARD HOUSE UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Donna creeps down the carpeted corridor and into her bedroom.

                                                                    

                DONNA'S BEDROOM NIGHT

               As Donna enters, HARRIET, Donna's thirteen year old whiz-kid 
               sister, lies on the bed, chewing on a pencil, writing a poem. 
               A radio is on softly in background.

                                     HARRIET
                         Which do you like better, "the blossom 
                         of the evening" or the "full flower 
                         of the evening"?

                                     DONNA
                              (closes the door, 
                              hushed)
                         Now listen to me, squirt, this is 
                         serious.

                                     HARRIET
                         Well, this is serious too.

                                     DONNA
                         Shhhhh... I'm going out the window 
                         in a few minutes and you're going to 
                         cover for me--

                                     HARRIET
                         Aren't you aware that there's a 
                         curfew? They just announced it on 
                         the radio--

                                     DONNA
                         I know there's a curfew, Einstein, 
                         that's why I need you to cover for 
                         me.

                                     HARRIET
                         I suppose this'll include a phone 
                         conversation with Mike, Mr. Bonehead 
                         Boyfriend.

                                     DONNA
                         This is about Laura. And it's really 
                         serious.

                                     HARRIET
                         Check.

               They squeeze each other's hands with strong and pure sisterly 
               affection. Donna puts on her jacket, slides open the window.

                                     DONNA
                         I'm gonna need to borrow your bike.

                                     HARRIET
                         Oh, well then put a little air in 
                         the back tire.

                                     DONNA
                         Don't forget to brush your teeth.

               Donna steps out into the branches of a large oak tree.

                                                                    

                HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT

               Donna drops silently to the ground from the oak tree and 
               creeps around the house, out of sight of the windows. She 
               ducks alongside a hedge edging the yard and into an alley 
               behind the house.

               Donna takes Harriet's bike, leaning against the side of the 
               garage, climbs on the bike and pedals down the deserted alley.

                                                                    

                NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

               Donna rides silently through the quiet streets and turns 
               onto the Highway 21 service road.

                                                                    

                CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

               Mike Nelson and Bobby Briggs are loitering by the magazine 
               rack, slightly beered-up. They're waiting for a CUSTOMER at 
               the register to exit. He finally does. The CASHIER says to 
               Mike and Bobby...

                                     CASHIER
                         Okay, bring it here. Make it fast.

               Mike quickly lugs a case of beer to the counter. Bobby throws 
               down some bills. The Cashier rings up the sale.

                                     BOBBY
                              (a strange smile)
                         Fuel for the party animal.

                                     CASHIER
                         You guys better stay off the streets 
                         with that; there's a curfew tonight.

               Bobby picks up the case and they quickly exit.

                                                                    

                CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

               They climb into Bobby's convertible. Both crack open a cool 
               one and chug it as Bobby revs up the engine.

                                     BOBBY
                         That biker? That "J" must be for 
                         James... James Hurley.

                                     MIKE
                         What're we gonna do about it?

                                     BOBBY
                         They weren't at "Hemingway's", 
                         bastards are hidin' out!

                                     MIKE
                         There's always some of those eggheads 
                         hangin' out at the Roadhouse.

                                     BOBBY
                         We're gonna go down there...

                                     MIKE
                         No, first we're gonna get Donna and 
                         get some answers.

                                     BOBBY
                         Let's boogie.

               They speed off.

                                                                    

                POOL HALL - NIGHT

               Donna rides up and leans her bike against the side of a crude, 
               one-story cinderblock building with a sign that reads: "21" 
               BILLIARDS: RACK 'EM UP." Donna enters.

                                                                    

                POOL HALL - NIGHT

               Five tables under low lights, two being used. Rough PATRONS 
               sit at small formica tables, drinking beer and watching the 
               players. All eyes hook onto Donna, the only woman in the 
               jo

                                                                    

                BOBBY'S CONVERTIBLE - NIGHT

               Bobby and Mike cruise down the street. They both finish their 
               beers and toss the cans into the road. They pull up and park 
               in front of Donna's house. Mike hops over the door and starts 
               towards the door.

                                     BOBBY
                         Don't take any more crap from that 
                         pretty bitch.

                                                                    

                HAYWARD HOUSE FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

               Mike reaches the door and rings the doorbell.

                                                                    

                DONNA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Harriet hears the doorbell, goes to the window, looks out 
               and sees Mike standing at the door and Bobby in the car at 
               the curb. She droops down on the bed.

                                     HARRIET
                              (to herself)
                         The best laid plans of mice and men.

                                                                    

                HAYWARD HOUSE FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

               Dr. Hayward opens the door.

                                     MIKE
                         Hi, Dr. Hayward, I'd like to talk to 
                         Donna?

                                     HAYWARD
                              (smells the beer)
                         She's upstairs getting ready for 
                         bed, Mike. Hope you're not drinking 
                         and driving.

                                     MIKE
                         We're all pretty broken up about 
                         what happened today. Besides, Bobby's 
                         driving.

                                     HAYWARD
                              (pause, firmly)
                         I'll see if she wants to come down. 
                         Mike, if you wouldn't mind waiting 
                         out here.

               Dr. Hayward closes the door. Mike turns, makes a "what can 
               you do" gesture to Bobby.

                                     BOBBY
                              (yells back to him)
                         Get it in gear, Snake!

                                                                    

                HAYWARD HOUSE UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY

               Dr. Hayward knocks on the door and enters Donna's bedroom

                                                                    

                DONNA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               A contrite Harriet sits on the bed, waiting, as her father 
               enters.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Where's your sister?

                                     HARRIET
                         I'm gonna tell it to you and I'm 
                         gonna tell it to you straight.

                                     HAYWARD
                         All right.

                                     HARRIET
                         See that window?

                                                                    

                SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               On her headset, Lucy the dispatcher answers an incoming call.

                                     LUCY
                         Sheriff's Office... Sheriff's out 
                         right now, Dr. Hayward, but I can 
                         patch you through to him...

               She patches the phone line into a radio dispatch line.

                                                                    

                ROADHOUSE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               The Sheriff's cruiser is parked among the crush of cars in 
               the roadhouse parking lot.

                                                                    

                SHERIFF'S CRUISER - NIGHT

               Steadman and Cooper are in the front seat. Cooper is whittling 
               a small stick with a pocket knife. Through the windshield, 
               they have a prime view of "Hemingway's", behind the Roadhouse 
               building. About twenty motorcycles, mostly Harleys, are parked 
               outside.

               We hear the cruiser's two-way radio kick on.

                                     LUCY'S VOICE
                         Sheriff, I got a call for you from 
                         Dr. Hayward...

                                     STEADMAN
                              (picking up the mic 
                              and responding)
                         Put him through...

                                                                  :

                HAYWARD HOUSE SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Dr. Hayward on the phone. Harriet peeks out at him from the 
               bedroom door.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Dan, my daughter Donna's snuck out 
                         of the house, I don't know where she 
                         went, I'm very worried about her.

               Cooper nods, not surprised.

                                     STEADMAN
                         You rest easy. I'll put out an all 
                         points for her, we'll keep our eyes 
                         peeled

                                     HAYWARD
                         Thanks, Dan. Keep me posted

                                     STEADMAN
                         You bet.

               Hayward hangs up. STAY with Steadman and Cooper.

                                     COOPER
                         Of course she went out.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Meaning what?

                                     COOPER
                         How else is she gonna lead us to 
                         that biker?

                                     STEADMAN
                              (trying not to appear 
                              confused)
                         Right.

                                     COOPER
                              (pause; continues to 
                              whittle)
                         You know why I'm whittling?

                                     STEADMAN
                              (playing along)
                         Why are you whittling?

                                     COOPER
                         Because that's the kind of thing you 
                         do in a town where a yellow light 
                         still means slow down, not speed up.
                              (he smiles)
                         Couple a' months of this and I'll 
                         have that clarinet I always wanted.

               He whistles "Rhapsody in Blue" again. Steadman looks at him.

                                                                    

                HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT

               Dr. Hayward opens the front door. Mike hastily puts out his 
               cigarette. We hear the whine of Mrs. Hayward's electric 
               wheelchair approaching the front door.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Mike, Donna's not here. I've notified 
                         the sheriff...

                                     MIKE
                         What do you mean, she snuck out?

                                     HAYWARD
                         Maybe you have some idea of where 
                         she might have gone, maybe you could 
                         help us find her.

                                     MIKE
                         We'll find her. Don't you worry.

               He runs back to Bobby's car, jumps in.

                                     MIKE
                         Roadhouse.

               Bobby floors it.

                                                                    

                POOL HALL - NIGHT

               Donna looks at her watch, looks around uneasily. The pool 
               players and patrons are grouped around the room, watching 
               her, whispering to each other about her. SHORTY, the 
               Neanderthal-looking pool hall owner, comes out from the 
               backroom through a beaded curtain and approaches Donna.

                                     SHORTY
                         Sweetheart...

               She takes a step back from him.

                                     SHORTY
                         ...hey, settle down, is your name 
                         Donna?

                                     DONNA
                         Yeah.

                                     SHORTY
                         Police were by here earlier. Joey 
                         said he'll meet you at the roadhouse.

                                     DONNA
                         Thanks.

                                     SHORTY
                              (as she heads for the 
                              door)
                         Don't mention it. Come back any time. 
                         Set you up with a free rack.

                                                                    

                POOL HALL - NIGHT

               Donna gets on her bike and heads off down the road to the 
               Roadhouse, which we can see in the distance.

                                                                    

                ROADHOUSE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Mike and Bobby drive up and park. They get out of the car.

                STEADMAN'S CRUISER - NIGHT

               Steadman and Cooper watch Mike and Bobby head into the 
               Roadhouse.

                                     COOPER
                              (matter of fact, still 
                              whittling)
                         There's liable to be a little trouble 
                         this evening.

               Steadman looks at him. Takes a sip of coffee. And a bite of 
               doughnut.

                                                                    

                ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

               A warm but slightly seedy honky-tonk. A GIRL SINGER in black 
               leather is up on the small stage, fronting a four-piece, 
               avant-garde rock COMBO. She's singing a song called, "The 
               Nightingale."

               At a quiet booth near the back, Ed Hurley and Norma Jennings 
               are holding hands across the table.

                                     NORMA
                         Drapes?

                                     ED
                         Drapes. Lots of 'em.

                                     NORMA
                         Ed, please, you know how I feel about 
                         you; don't do it for me, do it for 
                         yourself, pull the pin, it's Tammy 
                         Wynette time, darlin'.

                                     ED
                         Yeah? What about you and Hank?

                                     NORMA
                              (obviously frightened 
                              at the thought)
                         I told you, I'm gonna give Hank his 
                         walkin' papers.

                                     ED
                         Before or after he gets his parole?

                                     NORMA
                         Ed, I love you, I'm gonna do what's 
                         right... for both of us.

                                     ED
                              (making light of it)
                         Your sweetheart's husband's in the 
                         joint for manslaughter, the word 
                         "parole" has a nasty ring to it.

               She manages a smile. Looking up, Ed sees Mike and Bobby enter 
               the Roadhouse, look around and head for the bar.

                                                                    

               FIVE BIKERS

               Some of the clean-cut group we saw during opening credits, 
               seated at a table down front, watching the singer. One of 
               them, JOEY, spots Mike and Bobby at the bar.

                                     JOEY
                              (looks at his watch, 
                              to the others)
                         Mutt and Jeff just crawled in.

               Mike and Bobby see Joey and the bikers. Bobby points a 
               menacing finger at Joey.

                                                                    

                THE ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

               Donna parks her bike beside the Roadhouse and heads for the 
               door.

                                                                    

                STEADMAN'S CRUISER - NIGHT

               Steadman and Cooper watch Donna enter the Roadhouse.

                                     COOPER
                              (still whittling)
                         Looks like sooner than later.

               He finishes whittling, looks at the stick, puts it in his 
               mouth and blows; he's made a whistle.

                                     COOPER
                         Why don't you whistle for a little 
                         back-up?

               Steadman picks up his radio microphone.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (the slightest bit 
                              testy)
                         I can see which way the wind's 
                         blowing.
                              (into the mic)
                         Lucy, this is Dan, can we get a back-
                         up unit down here at the Roadhouse? 
                         Make that two back-up units. And 
                         call Will Hayward, tell him we found 
                         his daughter and she's fine.

               He looks over at Cooper. Cooper makes a "thumbs-up."

                                                                    

                ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

               Donna enters the Roadhouse and looks around. She stops short 
               when she sees Mike and Bobby at the bar. Mike sees Donna.

                                     DONNA
                              (to herself)
                         Damn...

                                     MIKE
                              (yells)
                         Hey! Everybody's looking for you! 
                         What are you sneakin' around for?!

               Reaction throughout the bar. Mike and Bobby rise and start 
               towards her. Ed looks up from the back booth, sees them. 
               Donna sees Joey and the other bikers at the front of the 
               room. Mike and Bobby see her looking at Joey and put two and 
               two together. Mike grabs Donna.

                                     MIKE
                         It's the same thing! You and Laura 
                         are exactly the same!

                                     DONNA
                         Take your hands off me!

               Mike pushes Donna hard against the wall. Joey and the other 
               bikers rise. The Singer stops singing, the band starts to 
               tail off. Ed rises from his booth.

                                     NORMA
                         Watch your back, Eddie.

                                     ED
                              (to Mike, crossing 
                              the room)
                         That's enough!

               As Ed moves towards Mike, Bobby dips a hand into his letter 
               jacket pocket and slips on a set of brass knuckles. The bikers 
               start towards Mike and Bobby.

                                     DONNA
                         You heard him, stay away from me!

                                     MIKE
                         I didn't hear dick!

               Ed moves past Bobby and grabs Mike's arm. Bobby hits down on 
               the back of Ed's head with the knuckles and Ed goes down 
               with a groan.

                                     BOBBY
                         Lights out, Mr. Goodwrench.

               The band members are already packing their instruments. 
               Patrons are backing away.

                                                                    

               THE BIKERS

               Close the last few yards with a rush and the fight is on. 
               Mike lets go of Donna. She backs into the shadows. The 
               fighting is hard and vicious. Mike and Bobby have a size and 
               weight advantage, and are given to dirty fighting, but it's 
               countered by the bikers superior numbers and technique. 
               Approaching SIRENS are heard in the distance.

                                                                    

                STEADMAN'S CRUISER - NIGHT

               As they watch patrons pile out the front exit and the sounds 
               of the fight reach them, Steadman goes to open his door. 
               Cooper stops him.

                                     COOPER
                         Not just yet

               Steadman stops.

                                                                    

                ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

               Joey hears the sirens, sees Donna slipping away, says to his 
               compatriots...

                                     JOEY
                         You guys got it covered?

                                     ANOTHER BIKER
                         No sweat.

               The biker knocks Mike back with an uppercut. The SIRENS are 
               very close now. Joey moves over to Donna, grabs her by the 
               hand.

                                     DONNA
                         Joey--

                                     JOEY
                         Come with me.
                              (lowering his voice)
                         I'll take you to James.

               He leads her towards a rear exit. The fight continues behind 
               them.

                                                                    

                ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

               As Joey and Donna exit the rear of the roadhouse, two State 
               Trooper patrol cars are roaring into the parking lot. They 
               slam to a halt near the front entrance and four TROOPERS 
               pour out of the cars towards the Roadhouse.

                                                                    

                STEADMAN'S CRUISER - NIGHT

               Steadman and Cooper watch Donna and Joey hop onto the back 
               of his motorcycle and he stomps the engine to life. Steadman 
               and Cooper look at each other.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Joey Paulson. That's a "J."

                                     COOPER
                         He's taking her to somebody else.

               Steadman looks at him again.

                                     STEADMAN
                         I suppose you want me to follow them 
                         at a discreet distance.

                                     COOPER
                         Dan, you're all right.

               Steadman starts the car.

                                                                    

                ROADHOUSE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Joey and Donna ride out a rear driveway exit. Steadman and 
               Cooper follow at a discreet distance.

                                                                    

                JOEY'S MOTORCYCLE - NIGHT

               Donna grabs Joey's back. Joey looks in his rearview mirror.

                                                                  :

               JOEY'S POV - THE MIRROR

               Joey sees Steadman's cruiser behind them.

                                     JOEY
                              (to Donna)
                         Hold on!

               Joey guns it up Sparkwood Mountain Road.

                                                                    

               STEADMAN AND COOPER'S POV

               Through the windshield, as the motorcycle pulls away.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (deadpan)
                         Gee, you think they spotted us?

                                     COOPER
                         Gimme a doughnut.

                                                                    

                JOEY'S MOTORCYCLE - NIGHT

               Joey reaches the top of the hill, glances behind him, smiles, 
               then turns right off the road and into the woods. Within 
               moments they completely disappear. Pause. Steadman's cruiser 
               reaches the top of the hill and continues straight past the 
               turnoff.

                                         ACT SIX

               FADE IN:

                WOODS ROAD - NIGHT

               Steadman's cruiser is stopped by the side of this remote 
               road.

                                                                    

                CRUISER - NIGHT

               Steadman and Cooper have the windows open, listening. Cooper 
               takes a deep breath.

                                     COOPER
                         Man... smell those trees. Smell those 
                         Ponderosa Pines.

               We hear a far-off sound of a motor; it could be a motorcycle.

                                     STEADMAN
                         I think I hear it.

               The sound fades.

                                     COOPER
                              (pointing in the 
                              direction of the 
                              sound)
                         What's down there?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Logging road. The only access is 
                         from the Packard Mill.

               He starts the engine and executes a fast turn.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (angry at himself)
                         And I told Hayward his daughter was 
                         okay.

                                     COOPER
                         My fault, Dan, not yours.

               The cruiser flies down the road past a sign that reads: 
               "PACKARD MILL EXIT, 5 MILES."

                                                                    

                WOODS - NIGHT

               A quiet clearing in the woods. SOUND of an approaching 
               motorcycle. Joey and Donna drive out of the woods into the 
               clearing. Joey stops the cycle. Donna gets off. Joey turns 
               off the engine. Night sounds and silence. They wait. We hear 
               sirens, way off in the distance.

               Donna hears the sound of a motorcycle. It comes closer. James 
               Hurley rides into the clearing on his cycle. He nods to Joey.

                                     JAMES
                         Thanks, Joey.

                                     JOEY
                         No problem, James.

               Joey fires up his cycle, nods to Donna and rides off, James 
               kills the engine and gets off his cycle. The sound of Joey's 
               bike fades away.

               James and Donna look at each other. They embrace.

                                     DONNA
                         She loved you so much. You must be 
                         dying inside.

               They separate.

                                     JAMES
                         And you...
                              (a different thought)
                         I still can't believe it. I don't 
                         know if I'll ever believe it. I'll 
                         never see her again.
                              (fights back tears)

                                     DONNA
                         They're looking for you, I didn't 
                         tell them anything, but I have to 
                         tell you--

                                     JAMES
                         I'm gonna talk to them. But I think 
                         they're going to lock me up--

                                     DONNA
                         Why?

                                     JAMES
                         I don't have any alibi for last night--
                              (anguished)
                         I was with her, I saw her last night. 
                         She snuck out, we went riding. Out 
                         here. I have to explain this to you.

               Donna's silent, waiting.

                                     JAMES
                         We had a fight. She told me some 
                         things. About her, about herself. 
                         She said, "There are things about 
                         me. Even Donna doesn't know me."

                                     DONNA
                         What do you mean?

                                     JAMES
                         I'm telling you, there were things 
                         she was involved with, things she 
                         let herself get pulled into, things 
                         she thought you'd hate her for.

                                     DONNA
                         Tell me what you're talking about.

                                     JAMES
                         She told me these things, then she 
                         said she wanted me to be a part of 
                         it, she wanted to be with me but she 
                         couldn't help herself...

                                     DONNA
                         James...

                                     JAMES
                         She wanted me to get high with her 
                         last night. She was different, she 
                         was on something. It was kind of 
                         like a nightmare... Donna, she was a 
                         different person. This is why I had 
                         to see you, it all makes some kind 
                         of terrible sense that she died, 
                         that someone killed her, I don't 
                         know, I can't explain it--

                                     DONNA
                              (leveling with him)
                         I knew her. I knew her better than 
                         she thought.

                                     JAMES
                         Did she ever tell you any of this?

                                     DONNA
                         She didn't have to. Sometimes it was 
                         just a look on her face. There were 
                         things that Mike and Bobby said--

                                     JAMES
                         Mike and Bobby. Those bastards! They 
                         were involved with this, I don't 
                         know how exactly--but she said you 
                         weren't in on any of it.

                                     DONNA
                         I was her friend. I wanted to help 
                         her but whenever we got too close to 
                         it she always seemed too ashamed--

                                     JAMES
                         I got really mad at her last night, 
                         she was screaming stuff at me, crazy 
                         stuff, people she was seeing, people 
                         she met through Mike and Bobby, people 
                         she started seeing again, and Donna, 
                         she said something about a guy getting 
                         killed--

                                     DONNA
                         Who?

                                     JAMES
                         She didn't say, but she said Bobby 
                         told her that he killed this guy--

                                     DONNA
                         Oh my God...

                                     JAMES
                         I didn't know whether to believe any 
                         of it, half the time she wasn't making 
                         any sense, but then when they found 
                         her this morning...

                                     DONNA
                         James, what happened last night?

                                     JAMES
                         She was hysterical, I couldn't calm 
                         her down, it was after midnight, we 
                         started driving down the Hill, I 
                         could hardly keep her on the bike, I 
                         was trying to hold onto her, it was 
                         like she wanted to jump off right 
                         onto the highway--we stopped at the 
                         light at Sparkwood and "21" and she 
                         did something so strange, she grabbed 
                         me around the neck and she screamed 
                         she loved me--I looked in her eyes, 
                         they were clear, it was like she was 
                         Laura again. She was so sad. She 
                         sounded so desperate, I'll never 
                         forget it... then she ran off... 
                         that was the last time I saw her... 
                         the way she said it, that she loved 
                         me... I let her go and she died...

               He can't fight back the tears. She starts to cry. They blindly 
               move into each others arms.

                                     DONNA
                         It's not your fault... it's not your 
                         fault...

               Her face moves up close to his. Their tears intermingle.

                                     DONNA
                         It's okay... it's okay...

               She strokes the back of his head. He squeezes her. The 
               comforting moves more towards need.

                                     DONNA
                         James... James, it's okay...

               His lips find hers. They kiss with urgent, building passion, 
               yielding to it and to each other. Then something stops them 
               both simultaneously. They pull slightly away and look at 
               each other.

                                     DONNA
                         Oh my God...

                                     JAMES
                         I'm sorry.

                                     DONNA
                         Oh my God...

               She touches his cheek lightly. He looks at her.

                                     JAMES
                         I changed my mind. I'm not sorry.

               She gently lays her head on his shoulder. Approaching SIRENS 
               are heard again in the distance.

                                     JAMES
                              (reacting to the sirens)
                         I've got to go to the police. I'm 
                         gonna tell 'em what I told you. I 
                         don't have an alibi. After she left 
                         I just rode around most of the night. 
                         When Bobby finds out about me and 
                         Laura--

                                     DONNA
                         I think they already know.

                                     JAMES
                         I want you to watch out for those 
                         two.

                                     DONNA
                              (remembering)
                         James, that necklace you gave Laura, 
                         the other half of the gold heart, 
                         you've got to give it to me.

                                     JAMES
                         Why?

                                     DONNA
                         They found the other half, where she 
                         was killed. They think the killer 
                         has the other half. If you go down 
                         there with the necklace and no alibi--

                                     JAMES
                         What about you?

                                     DONNA
                         I'll get rid of it.

                                     JAMES
                         No--

                                     DONNA
                         I'll hide it somewhere.

                                     JAMES
                         All right.
                              (looks at her directly)
                         Let's bury it, right here.

               She senses that this act is about what just happened between 
               them. With the heel of his boot, James digs out a shallow 
               trench. He opens his hand, they both look at the necklace. 
               He lets the necklace slide out of his hand into the hole. 
               She kneels down and covers the necklace with dirt. James 
               reaches back, comes up with a white rock and uses it to mark 
               the burial spot.

               The sirens come closer.

                                     JAMES
                         We should go. I'll take you home--

                                     DONNA
                         We shouldn't be seen together. I 
                         snuck out to see you, there's a curfew--

                                     JAMES
                         Climb on.

               They move to his cycle. He climbs on and starts it. She gets 
               on the back. He turns back to her, she slides her arms around 
               him. They take off. Up through the woods, towards the highway.

                                                                    

                DIRT PATH - NIGHT

               Donna and James ride through the woods. They come to a sharp 
               crest, onto the surface of the highway and speed off past 
               the sign that reads: "PACKARD MILL EXIT 5 MILES."

                                                                    

                STEADMAN'S CRUISER - NIGHT

               Steadman and Cooper sit parked off the exit, watching the 
               highway and the Mill Road. Cooper's leaning out of the window, 
               looking up at the night sky.

                                     COOPER
                              (overawed)
                         There's the Little Dipper... Orion's 
                         belt... I never saw so many stars...

               They hear James' approaching motorcycle. Moments later it 
               flies by their line of sight.

                                     COOPER
                         What goes around, comes around.

               Steadman steers the cruiser out after them, hits the siren 
               and lights.

                                                                    

                JAMES' MOTORCYCLE - NIGHT

               James looks back at the Sheriff's cruiser and decides not to 
               run. He slows and pulls off the side of the road. Moments 
               later, Steadman's cruiser pulls up behind them.

                                                                  :

                STEADMAN'S CRUISER - NIGHT

               Steadman sees who's on the bike.

                                     STEADMAN
                         That's not Joey that's James Hurley.

                                     COOPER
                         He'll do.

               Steadman draws his gun, picks up the microphone and flips on 
               his external speaker.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (amplified)
                         James, stand away from the bike, 
                         stand away from the girl and put 
                         your hands on top of your head.

               James follows the instructions.

                                     DONNA
                              (moving towards 
                              Steadman)
                         He didn't do anything!

                                     COOPER
                         She's probably right.

               Exasperated, Steadman looks at him.

                                                                    

                SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT

               A couple of TV NEWS CREWS and some REPORTERS are set up 
               outside the station, as Steadman drives up in the cruiser. 
               The Crews move in and tape Steadman and Cooper as they escort 
               Donna and James into the station. James is wearing handcuffs.

                                     NEWSMEN
                              (variously)
                         Sheriff, is he a suspect? What's his 
                         name? Is he being charged? What about 
                         the girl, are they both suspects? 
                         Sheriff, what can you tell us?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Nothing for you folks at this time... 
                         no comment.

                                                                    

                SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT

               Seated near the front desk, Dr. Hayward rises as Steadman 
               and Cooper enter with Donna and James. Andy Brennan comes 
               towards them as well.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Will, I'm gonna release her to you 
                         but I want her back up here for 
                         questioning first thing in the 
                         morning... Andy, give him a phone 
                         call and take James into holding--

                                     JAMES
                         My mom's out of town.

                                     STEADMAN
                         We're gonna have to hold you 
                         overnight.

                                     ANDY
                         Dan, we've got those guys from the 
                         Roadhouse back there--

                                     COOPER
                         Separate cell.

               Before Andy leads James off, Donna touches James' arm. 
               Hayward, Steadman and Cooper notice the tenderness in her 
               gesture. James eyes move from Donna, to Hayward and back to 
               Donna.

                                     JAMES
                         It's gonna be all right.

               Andy and James move off.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Thank you, Dan.

               Hayward and Donna move towards a side door. Hayward puts an 
               arm around his daughter and they exit.

                                                                    

                SHERIFF'S STATION SIDE EXIT - NIGHT

               On a side of the building away from the reporters, Hayward 
               opens the car door for Donna and she gets in.

                                                                    

                HAYWARD'S CAR - NIGHT

               Hayward gets in beside Donna and closes the door.

                                     DONNA
                         I'm sorry, Dad.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Donna, I'm sure you understand what 
                         you've put your and mother and I 
                         through tonight. I also know you 
                         well enough to know you wouldn't 
                         have done it unless you had a very 
                         good reason.
                              (she nods)
                         But we do have another problem facing 
                         us, young lady...
                              (mock stern)
                         Where... is Harriet's bicycle?

                                     DONNA
                              (breathes a sigh of 
                              relief, has to think)
                         I left it at the Roadhouse.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Well, we'll go pick it up.
                              (starts the car)
                         And I understand you promised Harriet 
                         you'd put some air in the back tire.

                                     DONNA
                         Yes I did.

               Hayward smiles, touches her head, lovingly, looks at her.

                                     HAYWARD
                         We're so thankful to have a daughter 
                         like you.

               Her eyes glisten, she smiles, nods, looks away. Hayward drives 
               off.

                                                                    

                SHERIFF'S STATION HOLDING CELL AREA - NIGHT

               Andy finishes putting James' belt and the contents of his 
               pockets in a large envelope, then leads James through a 
               doorway into the holding cell area corridor.

               On their way to the cell, they pass Mike and Bobby in a 
               separate cell. Mike and Bobby rise when they see James. Bobby 
               fixates on James, points a finger at him as he passes.

                                     BOBBY
                         You.

               James stops and looks at him, as Andy opens the door of a 
               nearby cell.

                                     BOBBY
                         When you least expect it.

                                     ANDY
                         That could constitute a threat, 
                         Briggs.

                                     BOBBY
                              (cold as ice)
                         Oh, gee, I'm sorry.

               James just looks at him.

                                     ANDY
                         Let's go, James.

               James enters the cell. Andy closes and locks the door.

                                     ANDY
                         Stick your hands out.

               James sticks out his hands, Andy unlocks and removes the 
               handcuffs.

                                                                    

                SHERIFF'S STATION FRONT DESK - NIGHT

               A weary Steadman and Cooper meet near the water cooler.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (hands him a Dixie 
                              cup)
                         Buy you a drink?

                                     COOPER
                         Dan, I forgot to ask you; can you 
                         recommend to me a good, inexpensive 
                         hotel or motel? Now it doesn't have 
                         to be fancy and I mean that.

                                     STEADMAN
                         I can get you a good rate up at the 
                         Great Northern.

                                     COOPER
                         Because my guess is I'm going to be 
                         here for awhile and you know a lot 
                         of these motel chains that advertise 
                         on TV promise a reasonable rate but 
                         then you get there and it's a 
                         different story. All I need is a 
                         bed, a bathroom, a telephone and 
                         sometimes a television, in the 
                         unlikely event that one day I'll get 
                         a chance to knock off early.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (slight pause)
                         I can get you a good rate up at the 
                         Great Northern.

                                     COOPER
                         Sold.

               Cooper offers his hand. Steadman shakes it.

                                     COOPER
                              (looks at his watch)
                         Tomorrow comes early.

                                     STEADMAN
                         I'll have Lucy make the arrangements 
                         for you with the Hotel.

                                     COOPER
                         I'll get my gear together.
                              (Cooper starts off, 
                              switches on his tape 
                              recorder, speaks 
                              into the mic)
                         Diane, it's 12:28 a.m., looks like 
                         I'll be staying locally at a place 
                         called the Great Northern Hotel--
                         Sheriffs getting me a rate...

               He's gone. Steadman crosses back towards his office, where 
               Lucy calls him from the switchboard.

                                     LUCY
                         Sheriff, just got a call from Mrs. 
                         Packard up at the Lodge, a possible 
                         prowler?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Probably raccoons in the garbage 
                         again. I'll take it, Lucy, tell 'em 
                         I'm on my way.

               Steadman heats out.

                                                                    

                STEADMAN'S CRUISER - NIGHT

               Driving through the deserted downtown streets.

                                                                    

                STEADMAN'S CRUISER - NIGHT

               STEADMAN DRIVING

                                                                    

                PACKARD LODGE - NIGHT

               Steadman's cruiser turns off the steep road and into the 
               driveway of Blue Pine Lodge, the large, log-cabin Packard 
               homestead. He parks near the rear of the house, exits the 
               car and moves towards the house.

               As Steadman nears the kitchen door, Giovanna opens it.

                                     GIOVANNA
                         Hello Sheriff.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Hey, Jo... understand there's a 
                         prowler up here.

                                     GIOVANNA
                              (as he enters)
                         Yes there is. Right over here.

               She pulls him the rest of the way in, turns off the lights 
               and in the dark, they kiss passionately.

                                     GIOVANNA
                         I've been wanting to do that all 
                         day. I felt so sad. So alone.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (strokes her hair)
                         Well, the sheriffs here now.

               They kiss again. He holds her. They are standing in front of 
               a large picture window, with a panoramic view looking down 
               over the Saw Mill on Black Lake.

                                     GIOVANNA
                         I used to think it was so peaceful 
                         here. Everything's changed. Do you 
                         feel it?
                              (looks out the window)
                         Can anything ever be the same again?

               We see a closer angle of the log jam where Laura's body was 
               found

                                     STEADMAN
                         It must've happened about this time. 
                         Twenty-four hours ago...

                                     GIOVANNA
                         I'm afraid.

                                                                    

                KATHERINE PACKARD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Darkness. Pete Martell is asleep in bed, snoring slightly. 
               Katherine, in a bathrobe, stands looking out the window, her 
               face gnarled in anger, looking at the Sheriff's cruiser parked 
               outside. She has the phone receiver in her hand, punching in 
               a number. She waits. The phone is answered

                                     KATHERINE
                              (whispers)
                         He's here again...
                              (she listens)
                         Alright.

               She hangs up the phone.

                                                                    

                GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT

               Benjamin Horne quietly hangs up the phone.

                                                                    

                SAWMILL DOCK - NIGHT

               Close shot of the log-jam where the body was found, logs 
               gently thudding together, as they bob in the black water.

                                                                    

                TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

               The gazebo.

                                                                    

                TWIN PEAKS - NIGHT

               The quiet business district. Sparkwood Hill looms up behind 
               the Town Hall and the train station.

                                                                    

                ED HURLEY'S GAS STATION - NIGHT

               No lights. No sign of life.

                                                                    

                THE ROADHOUSE DANCE HALL - NIGHT

               The sign's neon dancers flicker back and forth.

                                                                    

                INTERSECTION - NIGHT

               Sparkwood Road and Highway "21." The traffic light cycles 
               from green to yellow to red.

                                                                    

                DOUBLE "R" DINER - NIGHT

               Parking lot empty. Two LONERS at the counter.

                                                                    

                HIGHWAY "21" - NIGHT

               Empty.

                                                                    

                WOODS - NIGHT

               Thick woods. Sound of footsteps treading softly though the 
               brush.

                                                                    

                WOODS CLEARING - NIGHT

               A flashlight beam finds the white rock that James used to 
               cover the necklace. A gloved hand reaches in, moves the rock, 
               digs for and uncovers the necklace. The hand takes the 
               necklace, then replaces the rock. The light switches off.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

                                         THE END


FADE IN:
 GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY
Dawn breaks over the Great Northern.

 GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL ROOM - DAY
We hear him before we see him, but DALE COOPER is perched six
inches above the floor in a one-handed yoga "frog" position,
wearing boxer shorts and a pair of socks, talking into the
tape recorder which is sitting on the carpet near his head.
COOPER
Diane... 6:18 a.m., room 315, Great
Northern Hotel up here in Twin
Peaks. Slept pretty well. Nonsmoking room. No tobacco smell.
That's a nice consideration for the
business traveler. A hint of
douglas fir needles in the air. As
Sheriff Truman indicated they
would, everything this hotel
promised, they've delivered: clean,
reasonably priced accommodations...
telephone works... bathroom in
really tip-top shape... no drips,
plenty of hot water with good,
steady pressure... could be a sidebenefit of the waterfall just
outside my window... firm mattress,
but not too firm... and no lumps
like that time I told you about
down in El Paso... Diane, what a
nightmare that was, but of course
you've heard me tell that story
once or twice before. Haven't tried
the television. Looks like cable,
probably no reception problems. But
the true test of any hotel, as you
know, is that morning cup of
coffee, which I'll be getting back
to you about within the half
hour... Diane, it struck me again
earlier this morning;
(MORE)
there are two things that continue
to trouble me, and I'm not just
speaking as an agent of the Bureau,
but also as a human being: what
really went on between Marilyn
Monroe and the Kennedys? And who
really pulled the trigger on JFK?

 SHERIFF TRUMAN'S HOUSE - MORNING
A rustic log house, with the Sheriff's cruiser parked in
front. A rooster crows. SHERIFF TRUMAN exits the house,
carrying a soiled paper bag. He walks around the side yard to
a chicken coop and scatters the feed he has in the bag into
the coop. They start clucking and pecking.
TRUMAN
How you girls doing this morning?
Sounds like you got plenty to talk
about today. Hope it's good news.
He empties the bag and starts towards the cruiser.

 DOUGHNUT SHOP - DAY
A sign reads: WAGON-WHEEL DO-NUTS

 DOUGHNUT SHOP - MORNING
A banner reads: GO AHEAD, MAKE MY DONUT. Another banner
reads:
SQUARE DEALS ON ROUND DONUTS.
DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN and LUCY MORAN are at the counter, in the
middle of ordering.
LUCY
...two boxes of chocolate creams
with jimmies, a box of maple
bearclaws, one raspberry swizzle
twist, two boxes of jelly donuts...
(to Andy)
I'm ordering extra jelly donuts
because they're Agent Cooper's
favorite, you know my aunt I told
you about with the raccoons?
2.
COOPER (CONT'D)
(MORE)
She liked jelly donuts, they were
her favorite, but she doesn't
remind me at all of Agent Cooper.
(a new thought)
Her son, though, does--
ANDY
And one plum frappe turnover.

 SHERIFF'S CRUISER - MORNING
Truman drives past the Wagon-Wheel Do-Nuts just in time to
see Lucy and Andy leaving the shop, with Andy carrying a
stack of donut boxes up to his neck. Truman pulls into the
parking lot next to them and leans out the window.
TRUMAN
Can I give you three a lift?
LUCY
(looking around)
But Sheriff, there's only two of
us. Truman and Andy look at each
other.

 GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL DINING ROOM - DAY
Dale Cooper sits at a choice corner table, holding a fresh,
hot cup of coffee, as a WAITRESS comes by, holding the coffee
pot.
COOPER
(holding up a hand to stop
her)
Wait right there, wait right
there...
(he sniffs the coffee;
hmm... he sips)
You know, this is, excuse me, a
damn good cup of coffee. I've had I
can't tell you many cups of coffee
I've had in my life and this...
(another sip)
...this is one of the best.
WAITRESS
Thank you.
3.
LUCY (CONT'D)
COOPER
I'd like two eggs, over hard, don't
tell me, I know it's hard on the
arteries, but old habits die hard,
just about as hard as I want those
eggs... bacon, super-crispy, almost
burned: cremate it--

AUDREY HORNE
Across the room, watching Cooper order. She slips into her
beguiling, rip-your-heart-out routine and sashays across the
dining room to Cooper's table.
COOPER
(just finishing up)
...that's great, I'll have the
grapefruit juice, as long as...
(sees Audrey approaching)
...those grapefruits are freshly
squeezed.
The Waitress departs. Audrey smiles.
AUDREY
My name is Audrey Horne.
COOPER
Federal Bureau of Investigation,
Special Agent Dale Cooper.
AUDREY
Can I sit here?
COOPER
(pleasantly)
Miss Horne, unless I miss my guess,
your father is Benjamin Horne, the
owner of this fine establishment,
so I guess you can sit anywhere you
like. And I'd also like to add that
it would be my pleasure.
Audrey sits, a little confused, runs a hand over her
forehead.
AUDREY
You know, sometimes I get so
flushed... it's interesting.
4.
COOPER
Were you a friend of Laura
Palmer's?
AUDREY
Not exactly.
COOPER
Her father works for your father.
Did you know each other growing up?
AUDREY
Oh, we knew each other...
COOPER
But there was something about her
you didn't like.
AUDREY
Everybody liked Laura. She was just
Little Miss Perfect. Laura tutored
my older brother Johnny three times
a week. Johnny's twenty-seven and
he's in the third grade. He's got
emotional problems; it runs in the
family. Do you like my ring?
(hold out her hand to show
a big rock)
COOPER
Very nice.
AUDREY
My father bought it for me. My
father was crazy about Laura. He
bought her a pony when she was
nine, but he let her father say it
was from him. Its name was Troy.
(absent-mindedly rubs her
left palm)
Do your palms ever itch? Cooper
studies her benignly.

BENJAMIN HORNE
Crossing the hallway outside the dining room, he glances in
and sees his daughter sitting with Dale Cooper. He stops,
takes this in, then moves on.

5.
 LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - MORNING
The trucker, LEO JOHNSON, is obsessively cleaning the cab of
his semi rig with a dustbuster. A bucket of hot water, some
sponges, and a hose are at the ready nearby. We see that
Leo's name is stenciled on the rig's door, along with the
name, "BIG PUSSYCAT." SHELLY JOHNSON, in her waitress
uniform, comes up to the truck.
SHELLY
Leo, honey? I gotta go to work now,
Norma'll be here any sec... Leo?
Leo turns off the dustbuster and turns to her.
LEO
Did you finish cleaning my boots?
SHELLY
They're all done, and I did the
laundry, too.
LEO
All of it?
SHELLY
Well, yeah.
LEO
No you didn't.
He grabs a used grocery bag full of dirty clothes from the
cab and flings it at her.
SHELLY
Sure, Leo, when I get home I'll--
LEO
Now, Shelly.
SHELLY
Okay.
Shelly starts back towards the house.

 JOHNSON'S KITCHEN - MORNING
Shelly dumps the clothes out of the grocery bag onto a
laundry basket in front of the washer. She shakes out the
clothes before putting them in.
6.
She stops short when she sees a large, dark red bloodstain on
a faded blue cowboy work shirt. She starts to tremble. She
hears a car horn beep outside. She looks out the window, sees
Norma's car pull in near the truck but she doesn't see Leo.
She hears the screen door open and bang shut in the other
room.
LEO'S VOICE
Shelly? Norma's here.
Shelly makes a brave decision: quickly folds the bloodstained
shirt and stashes it behind the washer, dumps the rest of the
clothes in the washer, closes the door and starts it just as
Leo comes in the room.
LEO
Shelly, did you hear me say Norma's
here?
SHELLY
I heard you, Leo.
She starts out. He catches her by the arm.
LEO
I'm gonna come by the diner
sometime today. Be a good girl and
save me a piece 'a pie.
He pinches her cheek softly and holds it.
SHELLY
(manages a smile)
Sure, Leo.
He works her cheek for a moment, squeezing a bit harder.
Shelly hides her fear.

 JOHNSON HOUSE/ NORMA'S CAR
NORMA sits behind the wheel of a maroon '64 Falcon station
wagon. Shelly gets in beside her and they drive off.
NORMA
Leo sure does keep that truck up,
doesn't he?
SHELLY
He sure does.
7.
NORMA
(glances at her, sees her
condition)
We're sure a couple 'a characters,
aren't we, Shelly?
SHELLY
Norma, you said a mouthful and then
some.
NORMA
(shakes her head)
Guys...
SHELLY
(shakes her head)
Guys.
NORMA
You hear what happened at the
Roadhouse last night?
SHELLY
No.
NORMA
Big fight. Bobby Briggs hit Ed
Hurley with some brass knuckles--
SHELLY
Bobby hit Ed? Weird.
They look at each other, each knowing the other's secret, but
not saying so.
NORMA
Ed's got a concussion. Then Bobby
and Mike got into it with the
Bookhouse Boys, took two patrol
cars to break it up. Bobby and
Mike're probably still in jail.
SHELLY
(shakes her head)
Guys...
NORMA
Guys.

8.
 SHERIFF'S STATION ENTRANCE - MORNING
Re-establish.

 SHERIFF'S STATION RECEPTION AREA - MORNING
Deputy Andy takes a big bite of his plum frappe turnover,
just as Dale Cooper breezes through the front door and waves
brightly as he passes.
COOPER
Morning, deputy.
ANDY
(his mouth completely
full)
Good morning, Agent Cooper.
Lucy, at the coffee station holding a pot and a cup, turns to
face Cooper, with a doughnut stuck in her mouth.
COOPER
Hey there, Lucy.
LUCY
(barely intelligible)
Agent Cooper, I got jelly for you
special, the Sheriff's down the
hall in Interrogation.
COOPER
I'll just look for him down in
Interrogation.
He moves down the hall.

 INTERROGATION ROOM A - MORNING
Cooper whisks in just as Truman, coffee mug in hand, takes an
enormous bite of a humongous bearclaw.
COOPER
Hey, Sheriff: three for three.
Truman tries to chew, but holds up his hand to be patient.
Cooper sits.
9.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Number one, James Hurley: as soon
as his lawyer gets here, we bring
him up from Cell Four and talk to
him straight. He was in love with
Laura Palmer, my bet is she told
him whatever dirt she knew about
Bobby and Mike and who knows what
else... if James plays ball, we
send him off with our blessings and
a firm reminder to watch his back
when Mike and Bobby hit the
streets...
(Truman nods, trying to
chew fast)
Then we'll have a chat with those
two perpetrators, let's run a top
to bottom on Bobby's vehicle and in
the meantime, let's find out what
the autopsy report on Laura Palmer
gives us.
(he rises)
I've got the rest of the day mapped
out. I'll meet you back here in
Interrogation... I really have to
urinate. By the way, the coffee at
the Great Northern? Incredible.
He exits, just as Truman finally swallows his mouthful of
bearclaw.

 INTERROGATION ROOM A - DAY
JAMES HURLEY is seated, next to his LAWYER, across from
Truman, as Cooper enters and sits down beside the Sheriff.
TRUMAN
James has been advised of his
rights.
COOPER
James, you were placed under arrest
for suspicion of murder, the murder
of Laura Palmer. You have no
previous criminal record, is that
correct?
JAMES
None. No, sir.
10.
Cooper turns on the VCR and we see the same videotape of
Laura and Donna at the picnic that we saw earlier. James
watches the video.
COOPER
James, did you shoot this
videotape?
Cooper fast forwards to the freeze frame of the motorcycle
reflected in Laura's eye.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Isn't that your cycle, James?
JAMES
Yes, sir, it is. The three of us
went up there three Sundays ago.
COOPER
(gently)
James, you were in love with Laura.
(James is silent)
The two of you were seeing each
other secretly. No one else at the
school, or any of her friends knew
about it; she was the homecoming
queen, her boyfriend was the
captain of the football team. How
much longer did you think you could
keep this relationship secret?
JAMES
It was secret because that's the
way she wanted it.
COOPER
Why do you suppose that was, James?
Do think it had something to do
with Bobby?
JAMES
It had everything to do with Bobby.
COOPER
Why? Was she afraid of Bobby?
JAMES
I think so.
COOPER
Did you know that Laura was using
cocaine?
11.
JAMES
(pause)
Yes.
COOPER
Did you ever take cocaine with her?
JAMES
No, I tried to get her to stop.
COOPER
When was the last time you saw her?
JAMES
Two nights ago. The night she died.
For about three hours. She snuck
out of the house about 9:30. About
12:30 I stopped the bike at the
light at Sparkwood and 21. She
jumped off and ran away. I didn't
see her again.
COOPER
You're sure it was 12:30?
JAMES
Yes, sir, Steve's Liquor Locker was
closing up as we drove by and he
closes right at 12:30.
COOPER
You and Laura have a fight?
JAMES
Not exactly. But she said she
couldn't see me anymore.
COOPER
Why?
JAMES
She didn't say.
COOPER
Was she high that night?
JAMES
Yes.
COOPER
Where did she get her drugs?
12.
JAMES
I don't know. Most of the time we
were together she was clean.
COOPER
Did she get her drugs from Bobby?
JAMES
I really don't know where she got
'em, she never talked about it. She
didn't like that part of herself.
COOPER
Why did she start using again?
JAMES
(getting emotional)
I don't know. Something happened, a
couple of days ago--
COOPER
What happened?
JAMES
I don't know exactly. I think
something scared her. She wouldn't
talk to me, she wouldn't see me for
a couple days--
COOPER
Until the last night.
JAMES
Yes.
COOPER
Did she call you that night?
JAMES
Yes.
Cooper looks at Laura's diary, opened in front of him, at the
page for February 5th; the page marked "DAY ONE." He takes
the half-hearted necklace from his pocket.
COOPER
Did you recognize this necklace,
James?
JAMES
Yes, sir.
13.
COOPER
James, what happened on February
Tears form in his eyes. He fights them back.
WHITE OUT TO:
 PARK - DAY
LAURA PALMER, lying on a picnic blanket, playfully turns to
face James.
LAURA
What day is it today?
JAMES
Sunday.
LAURA
No, I mean the date.
JAMES
The fifth of February.
LAURA
Okay. It's an important day for me,
James. You've got three guesses why
I'm so happy today.
JAMES
Because you're the most beautiful
girl in the world?
LAURA
No.
JAMES
Because you have the cutest nose in
the world?
LAURA
No.
JAMES
Because your skin is soft and you
smell so good?
LAURA
No.
JAMES
Why?
14.
LAURA
Because I really believe that you
love me.
She takes the necklace from her pocket, "breaks" the heart in
two, gives half to James and puts the other half around her
neck.
WHITE OUT TO:
JAMES Sitting in interrogation. Looks up at Cooper.
JAMES
I don't remember.
Cooper looks at him.

 JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY
Leo is putting the last touches on polishing his truck, when
he's struck by a troubling thought. He throws open the door
of the cab and frantically searches behind and under the
driver's seat. He can't find what he's looking for.
LEO
Damn it.
He jumps down from the cab and runs towards the house.

 JOHNSON LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY
Leo hurries in, throws open the top of the washer, pulls out
the full load of soggy laundry and searches through them,
looking for the bloody shirt that he does not find.
LEO
NO!
Leo kicks the washer hard. The washer goes "tilt" and makes a
loud, rhythmic honking sound.
FADE OUT:

ACT TWO
FADE IN:
 DONNA HAYWARD'S BEDROOM - DAY
DONNA HAYWARD lies asleep in bed. The sound of an operatic
aria drifts through the room, originating downstairs. Donna
shifts, starting to waken, stretches and smiles like an
untroubled angel. Then her eyes open and she remembers
Laura's death.

 HAYWARD LIVING ROOM - DAY
Donna enters the room, where her mother, EILEEN, sits in her
wheelchair doing elaborate needlepoint, listening to the
opera on the hi-fi.
DONNA
Mom?
(Eileen doesn't hear her)
Mom?
EILEEN
Oh, good morning, dear, I didn't
hear you come down.
She uses a remote control to turn down the volume of the hifi and takes her daughter's hand.
DONNA
Mom, it's ten-thirty, why didn't
you wake me? I was supposed to go
down to the sherrif's--
EILEEN
They called this morning and said
they could wait until tomorrow to
see you. Your father and I thought
you should rest. You woke us crying
in your sleep last night, do you
remember?
DONNA
No, really?
EILEEN
We feel so badly for you, we're so
sorry.
16.
DONNA
(sits beside her)
Mom, it's so strange. I know I
should be sad, and I am, part of me
is, but I... it's like I'm having
the most beautiful dream and the
most terrible nightmare all at
once.
EILEEN
Your father told me you went out
last night to meet a boy named
James Hurley. Does this have
anything to do with him?
DONNA
(nods, decides to confide)
Can this be between you and me?
EILEEN
(takes her hand)
Of course it can.
DONNA
James and Laura were seeing each
other the last two months. They
fell in love. I was the only one
who knew about it. James was so
good for her, you don't know how
troubled Laura was, the kind of
trouble she was in and how much she
wanted to get away from Bobby--
EILEEN
I've been waiting for something
like this about Bobby. And what
about Mike?
DONNA
Mom, Laura and I made a pact. We
wanted to get away from them, from
both of them--
EILEEN
Are you saying you think Bobby had
something to do with Laura's death?
DONNA
I don't know. I think Bobby's
dangerous, I think he's capable of
almost anything.
17.
EILEEN
What did you tell the police?
DONNA
Nothing, I don't have any proof of
anything and what's terrible is
James was with Laura the night she
died, but Mom, I know he didn't do
it. Last night, I had to see him,
we were the two closest people to
her in the world. But I feel so
bad...
EILEEN
Why, angel?
DONNA
Because we realized that all this
time... we were the ones who were
falling in love. I feel like I've
betrayed my best friend...
(tears)
...but if that's true, then why do
I feel so happy?
Donna falls into her mother's arms.

 GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL OFFICE - DAY
LELAND PALMER sits behind his desk, talking on the telephone.
His SECRETARY sits across from him.
LELAND
...Palmer, P-A-L-M-E-R... yes,
that's correct, my daughter... her
name was Laura... I'm calling to
make the arrangements, the funeral,
everything, I want everything taken
care of, I don't care how much it
costs, and if you don't mind, I'd
prefer that we not discuss money...
During above, Benjamin Horne enters, stops and listens.
LELAND
...I don't understand the
question... what's the difference?
What do you mean "leak"... seepage?
I think I--
(loses it; almost a moan)
18.
(MORE)
--no, don't--
(screams)
DON'T TELL ME!!! DON'T TELL ME!!!
He pushes the phone and everything else on his desk away from
him. He gets up, crosses to a cabinet stereo, turns on the
sound on a modern jazz quartet record, 9/4 time, about as
loud as it can go. Benjamin goes to the Secretary.
BENJAMIN
(quietly)
Take him to the lounge and call Dr.
Jacoby.
She nods, goes to Leland, takes him gently by the arm and
leads him out of the room. Benjamin Horne turns down the
sound on the stereo, goes to the desk and picks up the phone.
BENJAMIN
This is Benjamin Horne, who am I
speaking to?... fine... mahogany
and teak? Well, you can forget
that, Mr. Formaldehyde, I'm picking
up the tab here and you vampires
are not taking a bite out of my
checkbook in order to exploit my
colleague's tragedy... start
thinking lead.
He slams down the phone, just as we hear, from outside...
JERRY HORNE'S VOICE
No, no, no, don't put 'em in my
room, in here, through that door
right there!
JERRY HORNE, Benjamin's younger, wiry brother enters,
followed by four BELLHOPS, carrying a mess of mismatched
samsonite.
BENJAMIN
Good to have you back, Jerry, how
was Paris?
JERRY
(shakes his head)
In a minute...
(turns back to the
Bellhops, points down)
Right THERE, no, no, right THERE!
The Bellhops carefully set the bags down as directed.
19.
LELAND (CONT'D)
JERRY
What's the matter with Leland?
Looks like somebody shot his dog.
The Bellhops all stop and look at Benjamin.
JERRY
What is WITH you guys? I've got a
sandwich in there and I want all
those bags opened--we're looking
till we find it.
The Bellhops hop to it; all the bags are opened. Jerry tosses
clothes around the room until he finds a baguette with brie
wrapped in white paper.
JERRY
Brother Ben, this is the best damn
sandwich I ever ate, it's a
baguette, with brie and butter, had
four of these damn things every day
I was there.
(he reaches in and finds
another one)
Got a couple left--here, try one.
BENJAMIN
(takes the sandwich)
Jerry, Leland's daughter was
murdered. And the Norweigans left.
JERRY
Did they sign?
BENJAMIN
No. The deal's off.
JERRY
We had those Vikings by the horns,
what happened?
BENJAMIN
One of 'em left a note.
JERRY
What's it say?
BENJAMIN
We're not a hundred percent sure,
they took the translator with 'em.
20.
JERRY
Did you say Leland's daughter was
murdered?... Laura?

 SHERIFF'S STATION INTERROGATION - DAY
DR. HAYWARD opens the folder containing Laura's autopsy
report, ready to share the results to Truman and Cooper. Dr.
Hayward absentmindedly tugs on a thread sticking out of his
sleeve.
HAYWARD
Harry, as you know, I delivered
Laura. I knew her her entire life;
she was my daughter's best friend.
I couldn't bring myself to do the
postmortem, so last night I called
in Joe Fielding from Fairvale. He
did the work, I assisted, this is
what he found...
(puts on glasses, consults
sheet)
Time of death estimated to be
between midnight and four a.m. What
killed her was loss of blood.
Numerous shallow wounds, no single
one serious enough to have been the
cause of death. Bite marks. On her
tongue, probably self-inflicted.
Lesions on wrists, ankles, and
upper arms, where she was bound.
We're waiting on toxological tests
for drug use. Within the last
twelve hours of her life, she had
sexual relations with at least
three men.
He tugs again on the loose thread of his sleeve; a button
pops off his shirt, hits the table and spins. He takes off
his glasses, wipes his eyes.
COOPER
And you've examined Ronette Pulaski
as well?
HAYWARD
(composing himself)
Yes. Wound patterns are consistent.
In my mind, there's no question the
same perpetrator attacked them
both.
21.
TRUMAN
Doc, when, if ever, will Ronette be
able to talk to us?
HAYWARD
She suffered a severe head wound,
it's still too early to tell, add
to that the psychological impact of
the fear, probably witnessing what
happened to Laura before her...
COOPER
The answer's in there somewhere.
Doc Hayward looks at a close-up picture of Laura taken where
she was found on the beach.
HAYWARD
So beautiful. Who would do a thing
like that?

 HOLDING CELL - DAY
Mike and Bobby sit on their steel cots. Mike moves to Bobby,
who's hanging his head upside down off the back of the cot,
kneels down beside him and speaks to him quietly.
MIKE
Hey Bopper... since when does Leo
Johnson call me at my parent's
house?
BOBBY
Leo called you?
MIKE
Yesterday. He was looking for you.
He wanted to know where the other
half of the money was.
BOBBY
What'd you tell him, Snake?
MIKE
Hey, as far as I knew, he didn't
have any of it yet. I thought the
deal was we were supposed to give
it to him today.
BOBBY
I gave him half already.
22.
MIKE
(surprised and a little
angry)
When did you see him?
BOBBY
Hey, I saw him the other night,
okay?
MIKE
What night? You mean Thursday
night?
BOBBY
Yeah, Thursday.
MIKE
Wait a minute, the night we
followed Laura back to her place
after she left your house--
BOBBY
Check. We had a couple brewskis and
I dropped you off.
MIKE
Check.
BOBBY
(lowering his voice
further)
And then I went to see Leo, cause I
had this money burning a ten
thousand dollar hole in my pocket.
MIKE
What about the other half?
BOBBY
It's in Laura's safe deposit box.
MIKE
You didn't get it back from her?
BOBBY
She was supposed to hand it over
today. Then she went and checked
out on us.
MIKE
So how we gonna get that ten grand
for Leo?
23.
BOBBY
(wise-ass)
I don't know, Snake. Maybe we could
sell light bulbs door-to-door.
MIKE
That's great, that's just great.
This isn't funny, man.
BOBBY
You see me laughing?
MIKE
We're lucky we're in jail, you know
what's gonna go down when we get
out? Maybe we ought'a figure a way
to stay in here--
BOBBY
(grabs his shirt)
Don't even think like that--and
don't mention one word about Leo
Johnson, you do not know Leo
Johnson.
MIKE
But what about--
The holding area door opens. Hawk leads James back in and
takes him back to his cell. Bobby jumps up from his cot and
moves to the bars.
BOBBY
Oh, look at that. Here comes that
accident waiting to happen.
HAWK
That could constitute a threat,
Briggs.
BOBBY
Gee, I'm sorry.
James enters his cell.

 SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT RECEPTION AREA - DAY
Truman and Cooper make their way towards the front, as ED
HURLEY, a bandage on his head, rises from his seat.
24.
TRUMAN
Hey Ed, how's that coconut?
ED
Kind'a tender. My pride's hurt
worse.
TRUMAN
Yeah, since when can some 18 yearold punk take Big Ed Hurley out,
even if he was wearing knuckle
dusters. Ed, this is Agent Dale
Cooper.
COOPER
(shakes hands)
Any relation to James?
ED
I'm his uncle. His mother's out of
town, called this morning, asked me
to come on over. You fellas plan on
holding him a while?
COOPER
No, we can release him into your
custody.
Truman looks at him.
ED
Let me understand; is James being
charged?
COOPER
I had one small doubt which James
has satisfactorily cleared up for
me. He didn't kill anybody. But you
tell him to be careful; we're going
to have to release Mike and Bobby
today as well.
ED
Will do.
Lucy calls from the switchboard.
25.
LUCY
Agent Cooper, I've got a call for
you from a Mr. Albert Rosenfield,
sounds like long distance, it has
that open-air sound where it sounds
like the wind blowing, you know,
like wind through the trees--
Cooper moves towards her to take the call. Ed takes Truman by
the arm and lowers his voice.
ED
Harry, I've been thinking about
last night at the Roadhouse:
something's not right.
TRUMAN
(kidding him)
Yeah, when I first saw the bandage
I thought Nadine might've gotten
wind of you and Norma.
ED
Harry, if Nadine'd gotten wind of
me and Norma, I'd be playing harp
for the Heavenly All-Stars. No, the
thing is I can remember Mike and
Bobby grabbing Donna, I stood up to
walk over and I got all
lightheaded, I was out on my feet
before I got there, I don't even
remember getting hit--
TRUMAN
What are you saying?
ED
I'm pretty sure my beer was
drugged. And you know who was
tending bar last night.
Truman thinks a moment, then nods.

COOPER
On the phone at the switchboard.
COOPER
Alright, Albert, bring the boys,
you guys can have the body all day
tomorrow... no, can't do it,
they're gonna bury her on Monday...
26.
(MORE)
and Albert, if you come through
Lewis Fork, I can recommend a place
for lunch, the Lamplighter Inn.
(waxing enthusiastic)
They've got a cherry pie that could
kill you.

 HARDWARE STORE - DAY
Carrying a small tray of sandwiches, Norma is going into the
hardware store down the block from the Double R Diner. She
holds the door open for a woman who's exiting, obscured
behind a big bag of hardware. It's NADINE HURLEY. Norma sees
her first.
NORMA
(pleasantly)
Hi, Nadine.
NADINE
What are you doing here, Norma?
NORMA
(pleasantly)
I might ask you the same question.
NADINE
(a hint of aggressiveness)
And I will tell you: I've gotten
all new drapes for my house. Ed
bought them for me yesterday at
Gentle Jim's and we installed them
together.They're a beige sheer. I
was up all night, do you know what
I was doing?
NORMA
(a little worried)
No, I don't.
NADINE
I was inventing a noiseless,
completely silent drape runner. And
do you know how it works, do you
know what makes it work? The thing
I thought of at four this morning
while I was waiting for my husband
to be released from intensive care?
NORMA
What's that?
27.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Nadine takes a package out of the bag, wrenches it open and
grabs a handfull of...
NADINE
Cotton balls. By God, those
things'll be quiet now.
Nadine moves off. Norma enters the store.

 SHERIFF'S STATION WAITING AREA - DAY
Ed Hurley rises, as James is escorted out and unhandcuffed by
Hawk. James moves to Ed.
JAMES
Did you have to post bail?
ED
Had a talk with Harry. No charge.
JAMES
(a source of pain)
Mom still out of town?
ED
Yeah. She's still out of town.
Let's get out of here.
JAMES
(nods)
Gonna need a hand from the
Bookhouse Boys. Somebody's gotta
watch my back.
ED
Already got it covered.
They exit.

 INTERROGATION ROOM A - DAY
Mike sits at the table, as Dale Cooper enters.
COOPER
So tell me, Mike, what are you
doing hanging around with a guy
like Bobby Briggs?
28.
MIKE
He's my friend.
COOPER
You don't seem like such a bad kid
to me, but Bobby Briggs could drag
you straight into hell. How long
has Donna Hayward been your
girlfriend?
MIKE
Around two years.
COOPER
Why were you screaming at her and
roughing her up last night at the
Roadhouse?
MIKE
That's between her and me.
COOPER
Between you and her, or you, her,
and James Hurley?
MIKE
What's that supposed to mean?
COOPER
You guys were out looking for James
last night--
MIKE
That's right, he was fooling around
with Laura, next thing we know
she's dead and he's out fooling
around with Donna--
COOPER
You couldn't find James so you
picked a fight with his gang
instead.
MIKE
They started it.
COOPER
After Bobby decked Ed Hurley with a
pair of brass knuckles?
29.
MIKE
He was defending himself--look, I
already spent a night in jail, are
you charging me with something?
COOPER
Settle down there, punk. I could
make one phone call and you'd go so
far away God couldn't find you.
Cooper smiles. Mike gets the picture.

 INTERROGATION ROOM B - DAY
Truman sits across from Bobby, filling out a report, when
Cooper breezily enters.
COOPER
Hi, Bobby, I was just talking to
Mike. Now before we get started,
have you got your stories straight?
BOBBY
If you tell the truth, you don't
have to get your stories straight.
Besides, the sheriff tells me we're
just in here for fighting and it
was self-defense.
COOPER
Right. Well, I guess you can go
then.
Cooper sits, takes the whistle he whittled out of his pocket
and begins to sand it with a small piece of folded sandpaper.
Truman looks at him.
BOBBY
...now?
COOPER
Yeah.
Bobby stands and makes his way to the door.
COOPER
Oh, Bobby...
(Bobby stops at the door)
30.
(MORE)
Pray for the health and safety of
James Hurley, because if anything
happens to him, we're coming for
you.
They look at each other. Bobby exits. Cooper stands and takes
out his electronic notebook.
COOPER (CONT'D)
What are you sitting around for,
Harry? We got places to go and
people to see.
TRUMAN
I'm gonna start studying medicine.
COOPER
Why's that?
TRUMAN
Cause I'm starting to feel like Dr.
Watson.
FADE OUT:

COOPER (CONT'D)
ACT THREE
DELETED
FADE IN:
 BLUE PINE LODGE KITCHEN - DAY
CLOSE on a trout as it's slit open and held under running
water. PETE MARTELL proceeds to clean the fish in the sink,
whistling a happy tune. In a dressing gown, over a negligee,
JOSIE PACKARD enters the kitchen, a happy look on her face.
JOSIE
On top of the morning to you, Pete.
PETE
No, Josie, the expression is "top
of the morning"...
(looks up at the clock)
...and it's just barely morning.
JOSIE
(pouring coffee)
So perhaps I should say, "Bottom of
the afternoon."
PETE
That'd be more like it.
Out of sight, below the counter, we hear a little dog bark.
Josie bends down to pet it.
JOSIE
Hello, Koro, good fellow... is
Catherine at the mill?
PETE
She wanted to run a half-shift on
account of us closing down
yesterday. I told her she was on
her own, I was goin' fishin'.
(holds up his string)
JOSIE
Pete, I want to thank you for
yesterday, for standing up to me
with Catherine.
PETE
No, Josie, it's not you I was--
(thinks better of it)
32.
(MORE)
Forget it. Catherine was wrong
yesterday--
The doorbell rings. Pete goes to answer it. He returns a few
moments later.
PETE (CONT'D)
Josie, the Sheriff and the gent
from the FBI are here to see you.
Josie follows Pete into the living room.

 BLUE PINE LODGE LIVING ROOM - DAY
Josie enters with Pete. Cooper and Truman rise.
TRUMAN
Mrs. Packard, this is Dale Cooper,
FBI.
COOPER
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
JOSIE
Thank you. Can I offer you
gentlemen a cup of joe?
COOPER
Mrs. Packard, you said the magic
word.
TRUMAN
I'd love a cup, thanks.
PETE
I'll get that for you. Mr. Cooper,
how do you take it?
COOPER
Black as midnight on a moonless
night.
PETE
Pretty black.
(Pete exits)
JOSIE
Please, grab yourself a chair.
They all sit. Out of sight, the little dog barks again.
33.
PETE (CONT'D)
COOPER
Look at him, what a cute little
fellow, what's his name?
JOSIE
Koro.
COOPER
(filing this away)
Koro. Koro. That means something.
JOSIE
Chinese. I am not sure exactly. My
late husband Andrew named him.
"Big, steaming engine" perhaps?
Cooper starts to bend down to pet Koro, Truman tries to
signal him not to. A growl, a yip and Cooper withdraws his
hand.
COOPER
Mrs. Packard, I'll come right to
the po Mrs. Packard, I
understand that you'd hired Laura
to come see you twice a week to
help you with your English, is that
correct?
JOSIE
Yes, you see my late husband,
Andrew... I first learned English
from him, when we met in Hong Kong,
but I have learned after his death
that he spoke only in what you
would call "western cliches"--
COOPER
That's very interesting, Mrs.
Packard, so you hired Laura to help
you--
JOSIE
That is the ticket, because I was
apparently not even saying the
cliches correctly.
COOPER
When was the last time you saw
Laura?
JOSIE
Thursday afternoon, about the time
the mill blew five.
34.
COOPER
That would be five o'clock?
JOSIE
Yes.
COOPER
When did she leave?
JOSIE
After one hour, when the lesson was
finished. I did not see her again.
COOPER
How did she seem to you on Thursday
afternoon?
JOSIE
Something was bothering her but we
did not have a heart-to-heart on
it. She said one thing, though,
which stuck to my mind. She said,
"I think now I know how you feel...
about your husband's death."
COOPER
Did she say what that was in
reference to?
JOSIE
No, but I think of it now like an
old song with a haunting melody
that I can't stop hearing in my
head.
COOPER
Uh-huh. Did you ask her then what
she meant by this?
JOSIE
It was just as she was leaving.
There was no time.
She stares at the floor. Cooper and Truman look at each
other. The phone rings.
JOSIE (CONT'D)
Excuse me, please...
She rises and exits. Cooper smiles strangely at Truman.
COOPER
How long have you been seeing her?
35.
TRUMAN
(about three different
reactions before...)
How did you know?
COOPER
Body language.
TRUMAN
Geez... uh, not long. About six
weeks. Andrew died a year and a
half ago.
Pete sticks his head back in.
PETE
You'd never guess; had to make a
new pot: there was a fish in the
percolator.
Pete exits.
COOPER
Was there an inquest into her
husband's death?
TRUMAN
Yeah. He took his 36-footer out on
Black Lake. He'd just put in a
customized, high performance
engine, there was an explosion on
board. We found pieces of the boat
but nothing of Andrew. It was ruled
accidental.
COOPER
(lowers his voice)
You never found the body?
TRUMAN
Don't look to me like that. He was
like a father to me.
COOPER
Take it easy, Harry, you're so far
above suspicion I can't even see
you through the clouds.

36.
 BLUE PINE LODGE KITCHEN - DAY
Josie is on the phone.
JOSIE
...yes, Catherine, I'm listening...
:
 SMALL PLEASANT MOTEL ROOM - DAY
CATHERINE PACKARD MARTELL is on the phone, sipping a drink,
unbuttoning her shirt.
CATHERINE
...I just thought you ought to know
what your sentimental good-will
shenanigans cost us yesterday, you
do know what shenanigans are, don't
you?...
Josie mouths the word, not at all sure.
CATHERINE (CONT'D)
Shutting down the mill for eight
hours, plus the night-shift, cost
us eighty-seven thousand dollars
and change. Do you really think
that would have made Andrew happy?
She hangs up. Turns and raises her glass and touches glasses
with Benjamin Horne, who smiles and swoops down for a kiss.

 BLUE PINE LODGE KITCHEN - DAY
Josie exits. Pete scrubs the coffee pot, whistling happily.
We move off him to reveal a small dead fish on the counter,
coated with coffee grounds, in a small, thin pool of steaming
percolator water.

 BLUE PINE LODGE LIVING ROOM - DAY
Josie re-enters the room. Truman and Cooper rise.
Preoccupied, Josie sits down, mouthing a word to herself.
Truman and Cooper slowly sit.
37.
TRUMAN
Jocelyn--
(covering himself)
Mrs. Packard?... Josie?
JOSIE
What is "shenanigans"?
COOPER
(word perfect)
Nonsense; mischief; often a
treacherous or deceitful trick.
Josie looks sad. Koro barks. Truman and Cooper look at each
other.

DELETED
 SMALL PLEASANT MOTEL - DAY
Cottages, a little vacation spot tucked away at the base of
White Tail Mountain.

 MOTEL ROOM - DAY
Catherine Martell is lounging in bed. Benjamin Horne is in
front of a mirror, trying his tie.
CATHERINE
Why do you always have to rush off?
BENJAMIN
(looks at his watch)
We've been here over an hour.
CATHERINE
There was a time when we'd take all
afternoon.
BENJAMIN
In the sweetness of passing time,
this hour will soon seem like a
day.
CATHERINE
Sing it to somebody else. I'm not
one of your teenage peabrain
chambermaids.
38.
BENJAMIN
(insincerely)
Oh, I'm sorry, did I offend your
delicate sensibility?
CATHERINE
My mistake. I'd gotten used to us
conducting business and pleasure.
BENJAMIN
Sweetheart, it's all the same to
me.
CATHERINE
Well I'm no schoolgirl either.
What's the next step?
BENJAMIN
(sits down beside her on
the bed)
We may not have to do anything: a
few more local tragedies and Josie
may run that mill into the ground
herself.
CATHERINE
You should have seen her, so proud
and weepy over that little
cheerleader's death, as if she was
the only one in the world with
feelings.
BENJAMIN
But the fact is those losses are
going to look beautiful in the
books.
CATHERINE
With the pace we've set, it'll
still be months before that mill's
bankrupt. I don't know if I can
wait that long. Besides, there's
always a chance my knothead husband
may decide to take a peek at those
dusty old books.
BENJAMIN
Maybe it's time for a fire.
CATHERINE
Are you talking about business or
pleasure?
39.
BENJAMIN
I'm talking about the Packard
sawmill.
(she gets the idea)
CATHERINE
All that dry wood lying around...
BENJAMIN
A stray spark one night...
CATHERINE
...when Pete's off on a toot with
Smokey the Bear.
BENJAMIN
(lust in his eyes)
Now I remember how those hours
turned into days...
He starts removing his tie. She smiles and reaches up for
him.

 GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL AND WATERFALL - DAY
Re-establish.

 GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY
Looking in on JOHNNY HORNE, in his Indian headress, standing
in the middle of the room, staring at the ceiling.

REVERSE ANGLE
Truman and Cooper looking in at Johnny, with DR. LAWRENCE
JACOBY beside them. Dr. Jacoby stifles a small giggle and
quietly closes the door.

 GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY
Truman, Cooper, and Jacoby move down the corridor.
40.
JACOBY
I can't get over it. He just stands
there day after day, I've never
seen anything like it.
COOPER
Dr. Jacoby, how old is Johnny
Horne?
JACOBY
Twenty-seven, going on six.
(giggles)
Just kidding. Sorry.
TRUMAN
And you've been treating him for
how long?
JACOBY
Treating him? Well, with Johnny,
it's not so much a question of
treating him--
COOPER
I understand Laura Palmer was his
tutor.
JACOBY
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday,
after school. Those were the same
days I'd come to see Johnny and his
mother. Laura was Johnny's
favorite. He knew which day it was,
too, he'd stand just like that,
waiting for her.
COOPER
Does Johnny get out much?
JACOBY
Sure, after his schoolwork... Laura
would take him out on the grounds
hunting for rubber buffalo with his
little suction-cupped bow and arrow
set. Some afternoons, he'd bag the
limit.
TRUMAN
Was she here on Wednesday
afternoon?
41.
JACOBY
Yes, she was. I sat in with them.
She read him a story.
COOPER
What story was that?
JACOBY
(thinks of it)
Isn't that interesting? It was
"Sleeping Beauty."
COOPER
You said Laura was a patient of
yours as well.
JACOBY
Yes. But of course all that
information dwells in the land of
client confidentiality.
(he beams at them, then
reaches behind Cooper's
ear and pulls out a
silver dollar)
Johnny loves that trick. He thinks
we've found over four hundred
dollars back there.
Cooper slow burns.

 PALMER HOUSE BEDROOM - DAY
A dark room, the blinds are pulled. A subdued SARAH PALMER
sits in a chair, wearing a robe. A NURSE enters, moves to her
and says quietly...
NURSE
Mrs. Palmer, I'm sorry to disturb
you, but Donna Hayward is here...
(Sarah reacts; off the
reaction)
...are you sure you're up to seeing
her?
SARAH
I have to see her. She was my
daughter's best friend.
42.
NURSE
Take this right now...
(Sarah sticks out her
tongue, the Nurse puts
the pill on her tongue
and hands her a glass of
water)
I'll send her in.
The Nurse exits. Sarah swallows the pill.

 PALMER HOUSE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
Donna is waiting in the hall, looking at a photo on the wall
of a young Laura playing, when the Nurse comes out of the
bedroom and moves to her.
NURSE
She's sedated. Try not to upset
her.
Donna nods and enters the bedroom.

 PALMER HOUSE BEDROOM - DAY
Donna and Sarah see each other and Donna moves into her arms.
They embrace, cry, then Donna sits beside her.
SARAH
What am I going to do? I miss her,
do you miss her?
DONNA
Yes, yes, I miss her so much.
SARAH
I miss her so much... I miss her so
much...
Sarah wipes away a tear, looks away, then looks back at
Donna, tilting her head, looking at her sadly. Donna's hand
slowly slides up and touches Sarah, comforting her. Sarah
looks down at the hand.

43.
SARAH'S POV
Looking at Donna's hand. She looks up from the hand and
sees... Laura sitting beside her. Sarah's arms reach forward,
clutch her and pull her into an embrace.

DONNA
As Sarah holds her.
SARAH
My baby... my baby...
Donna tries to gently pull away. Sarah won't release her.

SARAH Her eyes open wide, unfocused, looking up, seeing a
vision...

SARAH'S VISION -  HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Looking down a long corridor, a frightening-looking man we
haven't seen before comes racing toward us at full speed. We
hear some monstrous sound. Just as he's about to reach us
we...

SARAH She opens her mouth and screams and won't stop.
Terrified, Donna struggles and pulls away from her, trying in
vain to find some way to calm her, as the Nurse rushes into
the room.
FADE TO BLACK:

44.
ACT FOUR
FADE IN:
 GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - EVENING
As dusk is falling...

 GREAT NORTHERN CORRIDOR - EVENING
Benjamin Horne enters and crosses the lobby. He stops when he
hears some deafening rock MUSIC start coming through the
ceiling above him. He heads for the stairs.

 AUDREY HORNE'S ROOM - EVENING
Audrey is dancing by herself in the middle of the room,
swaying slowly and sensually to the music. Benjamin opens the
door and looks in, Audrey doesn't see him at first. Ben walks
over to the stereo and turns off the music. Audrey sees him,
looks at him with some attitude.
BENJAMIN
How many times have I asked you not
to disturb the guests with this
racket?
AUDREY
About four thousand times.
BENJAMIN
(getting right to the
point)
Audrey, Julie tells me you were in
with the Norweigans just before
they all suddenly decided en masse
to go back to the Old Country
without signing the contract. Is
that true?
AUDREY
Yes.
BENJAMIN
You wouldn't have done or said
anything that might have
precipitated their evacuation,
would you? I'm assuming it was just
a coincidence.
45.
AUDREY
Daddy, I did go in to check out
that ridiculous smorgasbord, and
while I was in there I happened to
mention I was sad--
BENJAMIN
About what?
AUDREY
(smiles)
About my dear, close friend Laura
being brutally murdered.
BENJAMIN
(red hot)
Wipe that smile off your face,
young lady. Do you realize the kind
of money your little performance
cost this family? If you ever pull
a stunt like that again, you'll be
scrubbing bidets in a Bulgarian
convent.
AUDREY
(mocking)
Oh, Daddy, I'm so afraid.
BENJAMIN
(pauses, very cold)
Laura died two days ago. I lost you
years ago.

 BOBBY BRIGGS HOUSE - DAY
Establish.

 BRIGGS DINING ROOM - DAY
BETTY BRIGGS is just setting dinner down on the table in
front of her husband, MAJOR BRIGGS, and son, Bobby.
BETTY
Bobby, it's your favorite: meatloaf
with pimentos and potato chips and
there's plenty more chips in the
kitchen.
46.
She sits down at the table with them. Major Briggs and his
wife bow their heads but Bobby doesn't.
MAJOR BRIGGS
For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly
thankful.
Bobby indifferently moves his meatloaf around the plate and
mashes up the chips with a spoon.
MAJOR BRIGGS (CONT'D)
Robert, I was hoping we'd have a
chance to discuss the events of the
past few days. Not the physical
events themselves necessarily, but
the thoughts and feelings
surrounding them.
Bobby rolls his eyes. Major Briggs is undeterred.
MAJOR BRIGGS (CONT'D)
Rebellion in a young man of your
age is a necessary fact of life,
and, candidly, a sign of strength.
In other words, I respect your
rebellious nature, Bobby. However,
being your father, I am obligated
to contain that fire of
contrariness within the bounds
established by society as well as
those within our family structure.
Bobby impatiently taps his water glass with his knife.
MAJOR BRIGGS (CONT'D)
Bobby, I note your reluctance to
engage in a dialogue with me, your
father. There are times when
silence is golden. Silence can be
taken many ways; as a sign of
intelligence... truth being
invisible... and the quieter we
become, the more we can hear...
Bobby shakes out a cigarette, puts it in his mouth. The Major
calmly and firmly backhands Bobby across the face. The
cigarette flies across the table and spears into the meatloaf
on Betty's plate. Bobby's stunned more than hurt.
MAJOR BRIGGS (CONT'D)
I am a tolerant man, but my
patience has its limits.
47.
(MORE)
"To have his path made clear for
him is the aspiration of every
human being in our beclouded and
tempestuous existence." Robert, you
and I are going to work on making
yours... real clear.
Betty removes the cigarette from her meatloaf.
BETTY
(sincerely)
We're here for you, Bobby.
Bobby's hands clench into white-knuckled fists.

 DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT
Re-establish.

 DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT
The diner's bustling with dinner traffic. Truman and Cooper
are seated at the counter. Shelly pours them some coffee.
SHELLY
Can I get you anything to go with
that, Sheriff?
TRUMAN
Agent Cooper here might want to try
a slice of pie.
COOPER
(brightening)
Cherry pie?
SHELLY
Best in the tri-counties.
TRUMAN
And could you ask Norma to stop by
for a second, Shelly?
SHELLY
Sure thing.
COOPER
(a twinkle in his eye)
Nothing's a sure thing, Shelly.
48.
MAJOR BRIGGS (CONT'D)
(MORE)
(Shelly moves off)
Shelly Johnson with a "j?"
TRUMAN
Husband's a trucker, Leo. Minor rap
sheet.
Cooper nods, makes a note as he sips his coffee. As he puts
the notebook away, he looks around and sees the LOG LADY
seated a couple of chairs away, cradling her log and drinking
coffee. Cooper looks back at Truman.
COOPER
(whispers)
Log Lady?
TRUMAN
Right.
COOPER
Hi.
She makes a sour face. Cooper turns back to Truman.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Can I ask her about the log?
TRUMAN
Many have.
Cooper ponders his choices. Norma Jennings comes out of the
kitchen with a piece of cherry pie, moves to Cooper and
Truman and sets down the pie.
NORMA
Evening, Harry.
TRUMAN
Norma, like to have you meet
Special Agent Dale Cooper.
COOPER
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
NORMA
Norma Jennings.
COOPER
I understand your husband, O. Henry
Jennings, is serving twenty-seven
months in state prison for
manslaughter.
49.
COOPER (CONT'D)
NORMA
(good-naturedly)
Yes, he is. I also have a cousin
named Sue who runs a beauty shop in
downtown Butte, Montana.
Cooper takes a bite of pie, closes his eyes and slips into an
ecstatic state.
NORMA (CONT'D)
Maybe I should come back with the
dinner menu.
TRUMAN
No need for me, I'll have the
special.
COOPER
(comes out of it with a
smile)
Where's my paper and pen, I've got
to write a poem about this pie.
TRUMAN
Better get your notebook; wait'll
you taste the special.
COOPER
Mrs. Jennings, is it true that
Laura Palmer used to help you with
the Meals on Wheels program,
delivering hot dinners to elderly
shut-ins?
NORMA
Yes. Laura helped organize the
program.
COOPER
When was the last time you saw her?
NORMA
She came in around dinner time the
night before she died to pick up
her meals for delivery.
TRUMAN
Do you have the names of the people
on her route?
NORMA
I could get them for you.
50.
COOPER
Would you please? And two more
pieces of that incredible pie.
NORMA
Okay.
She moves off. Truman looks at him.
TRUMAN
Man, you must have the metabolism
of a bumblebee.
The Log Lady is getting up to leave and leans in to them as
she passes...
LOG LADY
For your information, I heard you
speaking about Laura Palmer?
COOPER
Yes?
LOG LADY
One day my log will have something
to say about this. My Log saw
something that night.
She turns to leave.
COOPER
Wait a minute--what did it see?
She holds the log out.
LOG LADY
Ask it.
A moment of silence. They all look at the log.
LOG LADY (CONT'D)
I thought so.
The Log Lady exits.

51.
 CALHOUN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT
Establish.

 CALHOUN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT
Tommy "The Hawk" Hill is completing an interview with the
parents of Ronette Pulaski, JANEK and SUBURBIS PULASKI.
Ronette is visible in b.g., lying on a bed in intensive care.
A STATE TROOPER stands guard in front of the entrance to the
room. (note: do not show Ronette's face)
HAWK
(summing up)
So neither one of you saw Ronette
after school that day...
MRS. PULASKI
That's right.
HAWK
And as far as you know, she went to
her after school job...
JANEK
Yes. At Horne's Department Store
downtown.
HAWK
What did she do at the department
store?
MRS. PULASKI
She was a salesperson at the
perfume counter.
JANEK
She used to joke it was the bestsmelling job she ever had.
Mrs. Pulaski thinks of her daughter and gets a little tearyeyed. Hawk looks up and sees... ...the ONE-ARMED MAN looking
around the corner in his direction. As soon as the One-Armed
Man sees Hawk and the Trooper, he slowly recedes back around
the corner.
HAWK
Excuse me...
52.
Hawk rises and quietly follows the One-Armed Man around the
corner.

THE ONE-ARMED MAN
As he ducks into a stairwell and waits. Hawk's footsteps pass
by... The One-Armed Man quietly moves away, down the stairs.

HAWK Stops in the corridor. Listens. Comes back. He opens the
door to the stairway... empty.

 LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
In a long shot, Norma drives up, Shelly hops out and starts
for the house, carrying a bag of groceries.
SHELLY'S VOICE
Thanks, Norma. See you tomorrow.

 LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Shelly enters the house, sets down the keys. Silence.
SHELLY
Leo?... Leo, honey, you here?
She moves towards the kitchen.

 JOHNSON'S HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT
CLOSE on a new bar of soap being dropped into a dark sock.
Leo ties the sock off, swings it around, slaps it into his
palm a couple of times.
LEO
I'll be right out, Shelly.

53.
 JOHNSON HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Leo comes out of the kitchen, swinging the sock around.
Shelly turns as he enters...
SHELLY
Hi, Leo...
She sees the sock in his hand, turns pale and goes weak in
the knees.
LEO
Where's my shirt?
SHELLY
Shirt?
LEO
(advancing on her)
My favorite blue shirt. That's the
second one you've lost this year...
I'm going to teach you a lesson
now, Shelly, about taking care of
my property; that means not only
keeping things clean but making
sure things aren't damaged or lost--
this is gonna hurt you--
She pushes the bag of groceries at him and throws herself
onto the couch, protecting her face, terrified. The groceries
fall to the floor, something breaks and spills. Leo walks
over to the stereo and turns it on; loud, heavy metal. Leo
starts to spin over his sock, gaining momentum... and as it
flies out of frame, we...

 GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Audrey Horne is walking down a corridor when a gust of wind
slams a heavy door shut behind her. She jumps, then regains
her composure.

 GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Audrey moves down the corridor. SOUND of the wind continues
to howl. When she hears a voice she slows, sneaks around the
next corner and peeks through partially open door into...
:
54.
AUDREY'S POV - BENJAMIN HORNE'S OFFICE
Benjamin Horne is pouring a couple of stiff Scotches on the
rocks. He hands one to his brother Jerry, who's walking back
and forth, rubbing his hands gleefully together.
JERRY
Ben-jamin, Ben-jamin, Ben-jamin--
BENJAMIN
What the hell are you so happy
about?
JERRY
I'll give you a One-Eyed guess
where I'm going tonight.
BENJAMIN
Can you get your mind out of the
gutter for one second? We've got a
tottering empire on our hands--
JERRY
Come on, Brother Ben, I hear they
dropped a new bombshell up at
"Jack's"-- straight from the
perfume counter, am I right? Am I
right?
BENJAMIN
(he's persuaded)
Now that you've jogged my memory...
(sips his drink)
...and set it on fire... I'll
drive.
JERRY
That's the spirit: all work and no
play makes Ben and Jerry dull boys.
Let's roll!
They clink glasses and drain their drinks. Audrey moves away,
as they start towards the door. She turns a corner as they
exit and walk away.
BENJAMIN
After dinner, Jer. Gotta spend some
quality time with the squaw.
They move out of sight. Audrey watches them go, thinking.

55.
 HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT
Re-establish. James Hurley's Harley is parked outside.

 HAYWARD HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Donna escorts James into the living room, where Eileen and
Dr. Hayward are waiting.
DONNA
Mom, Dad... this is James... James
Hurley.
DR. HAYWARD
How do you do, James?
JAMES
Pleased to meet you, sir--Mrs.
Hayward.
EILEEN
James, very nice to meet you.
An awkward silence.
DR. HAYWARD
Hope you're hungry, James. Eileen's
been cooking up a storm.
JAMES
Yes, sir.
Another silence.
EILEEN
James, can I offer you something to
drink? We have soft drinks, fruit
punch, or sparkling cider.
JAMES
Fruit punch. That'd be good, thank
you.
DONNA
I'll get it, mom.
Donna exits to the kitchen.
DR. HAYWARD
Have a seat, James.
56.
EILEEN
You fellas go ahead and sit at the
table. I'll go check on the roast.
Eileen drives her chair towards the kitchen. James and Dr.
Hayward move to the dining room table and take their seats.
Donna returns from the kitchen and sets down a glass in front
of James.
DONNA
Here's your fruit punch, James.
JAMES
Thanks, Donna.
DR. HAYWARD
I don't believe I know your
parents, James.
JAMES
No, sir. My dad died when I was
ten. My mom... travels a lot.
DONNA
Ed Hurley down at the Gas Farm is
James' uncle.
DR. HAYWARD
His wife is the lady with the
patch?
JAMES
That's my Aunt Nadine. She's a real
character.
EILEEN'S VOICE
(from the kitchen)
Will? Can you give me a hand?
DR. HAYWARD
Excuse me, James.
He exits into the kitchen. Donna whispers across the table to
James.
DONNA
(more intimately)
We can talk after dinner.
JAMES
It's good to see you.
57.
DONNA
(smiles warmly)
It's good to see you, too.

 HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT
Mike and Bobby pull up outside in Bobby's car. They see
James' bike parked in front.
BOBBY
That bastard.
MIKE
First your girlfriend, then mine.
BOBBY
Too bad we can only kill him once.
He lights a cigarette. They drive slowly off. The rear
brakelights disappear into the darkness. The wind howls.

 DR. JACOBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
We hear a soft, cool be-bop tune. Lights are low. A pair of
strange, green orthopedic shoes dance expertly into view and
execute a few boss moves. We widen out to see Dr. Jacoby in
his fifties-style, Hawaiian-themed rec room. He picks up his
mail and sifts through it, continuing to dance. He stops
suddenly when he comes across a slightly bulky plain manilla
envelope. He opens the envelope and finds a single audio
cassette tape, without a case. Written on the cartridge are
the words...
"TO DR. JACOBY, WITH LOVE, LAURA"
Overcome with amazement, he instantly turns off his stereo,
punches eject, removes the tape that was playing, inserts
Laura's tape and hits play.
LAURA'S VOICE
(from tape)
Hey, what's up, doc? Ha-ha... it's
Thursday afternoon about four
o'clock and I'm so bored I'm making
you this tape on the pretty little
tape recorder you gave me...
We hear background noises on the tape; ambient sound from a
department store.
58.
Dr. Jacoby nervously starts eating malted milkballs from a
bowl on his desk, cruching them in a single bite.
LAURA'S VOICE (CONT'D)
...and as you probably already
noticed, I'm gonna mail it to you
in the ugly little plain envelope
you gave me... for, what was the
word you used? "confidentiality's
sake." ...this is kind of fun...
First, you're always bugging me to
tell you what my dreams are--let me
tell you about this one I had last
night: it was a doozy.
He reaches into his desk and takes out a pair of headphones,
which he puts on.
LAURA'S VOICE (CONT'D)
...I was in this strange room and
there was this little man and this
older man I'd never seen before
either, but they both seemed to
know me... there was music... and I
was telling all my secrets to the
older man...
He plugs the headphones in and we no longer hear her voice.
As he listens and chomps on the milkballs, his face registers
a whole gamut of emotions.

ACT ONE
 GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - EVENING
Establish.

 HORNE RESIDENCE WING - EVENING
JERRY HORNE sits before a roaring fireplace, tumbler of
bourbon in hand, eating nuts compulsively from a giant bowl
while rapidly adding figures on a large computer while scores
of numbers flash up and down on the large computer monitor,
all the while talking into a headset phone receiver in a
melange of Icelandic and English.
In another part of the spacious room, the Horne family sits
quietly around the dinner table. AUDREY HORNE plays
listlessly with her food. A NURSE helps JOHNNY-still-wearinghis- headdress-HORNE eat, while MRS. HORNE stares at her full
plate. For no discernable reason, Johnny bursts into tears.
The Nurse comforts him and he starts to eat again. In spite
of her feigned indifference, a small, sad tear slips down
Audrey's cheek as she watches her brother.
BENJAMIN HORNE finishes carving up and chewing a big rare
steak and looks around at his family. He puts his napkin on
the table, rises, then smiles.
BENJAMIN
Always a pleasure.
(calls to his brother)
Power down, Jer. We've got a
"meeting."
Jerry gets up, switches off the computer and does an Indian
dance towards and eventually around the dinner table, making
"traditional" Indian noises.
JERRY
(his idea of being a funny
guy)
Nephew Johnny, don't be forlorn...
things're bound to get better in
the morn... then there's Sylvia,
who treats me with scorn... she
thinks Jerry an absolute thorn...
He kisses her; Jerry repulses her. Jerry indian dances toward
Audrey. Johnny breaks down again.
JERRY (CONT'D)
...around the horn to little niece
Audrey, the Horne's first born...
(Audrey's amused)
...and here goes Jerry with brother
Ben Horne, long-gone like turkeys
through the corn...
Ben and Jerry exit.

 BLACK LAKE - NIGHT
A full moon in a dark sky illuminates the cold, placid
surface of Black Lake.

 HORNE CRUISER - NIGHT
A 1942, solid mahogany 22 foot Fitzgerald and Lee custom
streamliner runabout cuts through the water. Benjamin Horne
is at the wheel, his brother Jerry Horne beside him, spotting
ahead of them through infra-red, night-vision binoculars.

THEIR POV - BINOCULAR EFFECT
Bright lights on a long peninsula, their destination.

 DOCK - NIGHT
The boat glides up slowly to the dock. Jerry tosses a line to
a gorgeous young female deckhand, SWABBIE, dressed in a
skimpy, stylized, sailor's uniform. Swabbie ties off the boat
as a SECURITY GUARD, also dressed in a nautically themed
uniform, stands by, watching.
JERRY
Permission to come ashore?
SWABBIE
Permission granted.
Jerry gives Swabbie a kiss. Benjamin follows Jerry out of the
boat onto the dock.
BENJAMIN
Hey, Sailor.
2.
SWABBIE
Good evening, Mr. Horne.
Benjamin tips her a ten-spot and rubs her elbow.
SWABBIE (CONT'D)
Thank you, Mr. Horne.
Ben and Jerry start up a flight of stairs to the brightly lit
structure above. Swabbie picks up a phone on a piling and
pushes a button.
SWABBIE (CONT'D)
Horne brothers, comin' up.

 ONE-EYED JACKS - NIGHT
A large sign of a playing card, a one-eyed jack, with neon
flashing "J's" and one pulsating eye, is suspended over two
identical doors. On one of the doors is a small neon sign
that reads, "CASINO." Ben and Jerry come up to the doors and
stop.
JERRY
Now, are we gonna go into the
casino first?
BENJAMIN
I'm not here to lose my shirt, I
just want to take it off.
Jerry rings a bell on the door without the sign. An
electronic buzz, a latch gives, and the door swings open.

 ONE-EYED JACKS "LET'S GET ACQUAINTED" ROOM - NIGHT
Ben and Jerry enter a plush, cozy warmly lit room, easy
chairs, fluffy sofas and a small bar with a brass rail. Jerry
orders drinks from a scantily clad female BARTENDER.
JERRY
Sweetheart, I'd like to order two
drinks, one double scotch on the
rocks and my brother will have a
double scotch on the rocks.
(winks)
3.
BARTENDER
That's two double scotch on the
rocks?
JERRY
Next stop, rocket science.
Several of the establishment's sensational and extraordinary
WORKING GIRLS, known collectively as "The 52 Pick-Ups," enter
the room. They sit and luxuriously arrange themselves. Ben
and Jerry take note as they pick up their drinks. In sweeps
BLACKIE "THE BLACK ROSE" O'REILLY, the Madam of the House, an
intelligent, strikingly attractive woman in her midthirties.
BLACKIE
Gentlemen...
BENJAMIN
Blackie...
(he kisses her hand)
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's
day? Thou art more lovely and more
temperate: Rough winds do not shake
the darling buds of May, And
summer's lease hath all too short a
date: Sometimes too hot the eye of
heaven shines, And often is his
gold complexion dimm'd; And every
fair from fair sometimes declines,
By chance or nature's changing
course untrimm'd; But thy eternal
summer shall not fade, Nor lose
possession of that fair thou ow'st,
Nor shall death brag thou wander'st
in his shade, When in eternal lines
to time thou grow'st; So long as
man can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long live this, and this gives
life to thee."
During above we register Blackie's reaction, detached
amusement, and Jerry's reaction, bored indifference. Several
more Pick-Ups wander in and we pay attention to their
reactions and those of the others already in the room, who
see Benjamin an ideal of worldly sophistication and power.
Benjamin finishes and kisses Blackie's hand again. Jerry
comes up to her and says quietly.
JERRY
Which one's the new girl?
4.
BLACKIE
When you really want love... you
will find it waiting for you.
A curtain opens, revealing a gorgeous young WOMAN with the
face of an angel. Ben and Jerry look at each other, then
instantly back to the Woman. Jerry takes a coin out of his
pocket, flips it, and covers his wrist. Jerry and Ben look
down at the coin: heads. Ben smiles, pats his brother on the
back, and starts towards the Woman. Jerry slaps the coin down
on the bar.

A TAPE RECORDER
A tape playing in the small recorder comes to an end and the
"play" button pops back out. We see that the tape is labeled,
"TO DR. JACOBY WITH LOVE, LAURA."

 DR. JACOBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Deeply saddened, Dr. Jacoby finishes listening to the tape,
removes the headphones, takes the tape out of the recorder.
He moves to the artificial palm tree near the wall and
removes one of the coconuts from a branch of the tree.
Jacoby snaps open the coconut, which is actually a stash box
disguised as a coconut, slips the tape inside, snaps it shut,
and attaches it back to the tree.

 HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT
Re-establish.

 HAYWARD HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Dr. and Mrs. Hayward are clearing away pie plates from the
coffee table in front of a fire burning in the fireplace.
Donna and James are sitting on opposite ends of the sofa.
JAMES
That was great huckleberry pie,
Mrs. Hayward.
5.
EILEEN
You only had three pieces, James,
are you sure you wouldn't like
another?
JAMES
No thank you, ma'am.
DR. HAYWARD
How 'bout some more coffee?
JAMES
No thank you, sir.
DONNA
(a semi-subtle signal)
Dad...
DR. HAYWARD
(gets it)
Mrs. Hayward and I are going to say
goodnight to you now, James.
EILEEN
Good night, James.
DONNA
Just leave the dishes, Mom, I'll
clean up.
EILEEN
Thank you, dear, good night.
Mrs. Hayward steers herself into the kitchen.
DR. HAYWARD
Will you be joining us for church
tomorrow, Donna?
DONNA
Yes.
DR. HAYWARD
Nine o'clock sharp.
He winks and exits. Donna and James are alone. From another
room we hear the sound of an engine start up and whine. James
looks at Donna.
DONNA
Elevator.
6.
James nods. A slightly awkward but not uncomfortable silence.
He tentatively reaches over for her hand, she takes it. They
hold hands and look at each other. He slowly pulls her
towards him into a sweet, tender kiss. They look at each
other. She smiles. They kiss again, very passionately.
DONNA (CONT'D)
(whispers)
I can't stop thinking about you...
JAMES
(touches her cheek)
I've thought about you all day...
DONNA
I keep thinking of Laura, too.
JAMES
Yeah...
DONNA
What are we gonna do?
JAMES
Donna, I don't feel that what we're
doing is wrong, or what we're
feeling--
DONNA
Why not?
JAMES
Because it's the truth. Because I
think it would have turned out this
way sooner or later anyway--
DONNA
I don't know--you do?
JAMES
Yes. I remember a time in school,
remember, in the hall, we were
suddenly alone and we looked at
each other--
DONNA
I remember--
JAMES
I almost told you I loved you then.
DONNA
It's true.
7.
JAMES
It's true, isn't it?
DONNA
I guess because of Laura, I
couldn't say anything, I couldn't
even let myself think about it--
JAMES
Me too.
DONNA
(tender and trembling)
Are we...
(moves closer to him)
...are we... going to be together?
He kisses her. She kisses him. They kiss.

 GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - NIGHT
Re-establish.

 DALE COOPER'S ROOM - NIGHT
The door flies open. Long pause. DALE COOPER takes one step
into view, looks into the room, realizes it's safe, then
enters. He plays a little birdcall on his handcarved whittle
whistle. He sees the red message light blinking on his
bedside phone.
Cooper dials the operator.
COOPER
Messages for 315, Special Agent
Dale Cooper...
(he waits)
...Deputy Tommy "The Hawk" Hill?
Did he leave a number?
(jots down the number)
Deputy Hill, this is Agent
Cooper...
:
 CALHOUN HOSPITAL - NIGHT
TOMMY "THE HAWK" HILL is in the hospital corridor on a pay
phone.
8.
HAWK
Just thought I should let you know
everything's quiet here at the
hospital...
COOPER
How's Ronette Pulaski?
HAWK
Body and spirit are still far
apart.
COOPER
What did you find out from her
parents?
HAWK
Little. Ronette recently quit her
job at the perfume counter of
Horne's department store.
COOPER
Is that Benjamin Horne?
HAWK
Yes, sir, family business.
Everything else is good except that
at ten o'clock there was a onearmed man snooping around intensive
care.
As they speak, Cooper looks over and sees a note being
slipped under his hotel room door.
COOPER
One-armed man?
HAWK
Left.
COOPER
Did you question him?
HAWK
Negative. I pursued, but he got
away.
COOPER
Alright. Maintain a watch on
Ronette around the clock and we'll
talk tomorrow.
9.
STAY with Cooper as he hangs up, rises, and moves to the
note. He picks it up, opens it and reads...
"HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO ONE-EYED JACKS?"
Cooper sniffs the note and smiles.

 BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT
Establish.

 MARTELL BEDROOM - NIGHT
PETE MARTELL and his wife CATHERINE are uneasily coexisting
in a heavy silence. Pete sits on the edge of the bed, rubbing
some mink oil into his boots. Catherine folds some laundry
and puts it away in a chest of drawers. She sniffs.
CATHERINE
Everything smells like fish around
here.
PETE
Then why don't you wash your socks
separately?
CATHERINE
Why don't you drive your truck into
a tree?
PETE
(smiles)
I got an idea: tomorrow's Sunday,
let's stay up late tonight and
bicker.
Catherine takes some laundry into a large walk-in closet and
puts the clothes away. Pete quietly rises, silently picks up
a small vase from the dresser, dumps the contents into his
hand and takes out a small key with a tag.
CATHERINE
(from the closet)
What was that FBI man doing up here
today?
PETE
Nice fella. Asked a few questions.
10.
CATHERINE
About what?
PETE
He talked to Josie mostly. I had a
problem with a fish took a likin'
to my percolator.
CATHERINE
What did he talk to Josie about?
PETE
Why don't you ask her?
Pete sits down with the key in his pocket as Catherine reenters.
CATHERINE
Did they talk about my brother at
all?
PETE
Andrew?
CATHERINE
How many brothers do I have?
PETE
I heard them mention him. The
accident.
CATHERINE
What about the accident?
PETE
You know, the usual, how no one
found his body. Mostly they talked
about Laura. How she was up here
the afternoon of the day she died.
CATHERINE
Didn't he want to talk to us?
PETE
I talked to him. Real nice fella.
CATHERINE
Did he express any interest in
talking to me?
11.
PETE
Yeah, but we told him you were on
your world tour, he should contact
your press agent.
CATHERINE
Take your boots off my bed and go
to your room.
PETE
Didn't want to get mink oil on my
bedspread.
Pete rises and exits, whistling.

 BLUE PINE LODGE CORRIDOR/JOSIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
Pete wanders down the hall, taps on a door. JOSIE PACKARD
opens the door. Pete holds up the small key.
PETE
(whispers)
Don't use it til tomorrow. I'll get
her out of the house.
JOSIE
Thanks, Pete.
PETE
You bet'cha.
She takes the key and goes back inside. Pete moves on,
whistling. In her room, Josie opens a small rectangular
lacquer box. She presses the key into the hard clay inside
the box, making an impression of the key. She then removes
the key and closes the box.

 PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT
Establish.

 PALMER HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Feet pace restlessly back and forth across the carpet. LELAND
PALMER moves to the record player. A record drops on the
turntable. Big band music.
12.
Leland listens, sways, tries to get the feel of the music.
Decides it isn't right, not up tempo enough.
Leland lifts the stylus and drops the needle on another part
of the record, searching frantically for a particular song,
which he finally locates.
Big band again, but fast, loud and brassy. He listens again.
This time it's the right stuff; tears spring into his eyes.
He looks across at Laura's picture on the table. He starts to
dance, in torment of anger, sadness and nostalgic despair,
jitterbugging back and forth in front of the picture.
He makes a loud moaning, wailing sound.

 PALMER HOUSE CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Startled by the sound and the music from downstairs, SARAH
PALMER peeks her head around the corner of the corridor at
the top of the stairs.
She starts quickly down the stairs and moves towards the
living room...
:
SARAH'S POV
As the living room comes into view and she sees her husband
dancing.

 PALMER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Sarah enters the room where Leland is dancing and wailing.
SARAH
(frightened)
Leland?... Leland?...
He looks at her, goes right over her and grabs her.
LELAND
Sarah, we have to dance...
He tries to move her, trying desperately to dance with her.
SARAH
Leland, stop, stop it--
13.
LELAND
Sarah, we have to dance--we have to
dance--
SARAH
Leland, Leland--
LELAND
We have to dance--for Laura!
She starts screaming, he starts moaning and moving her around
in front of the fireplace. We MOVE in on the fire.
FADE OUT:

ACT TWO
FADE IN:
 TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF STATION - DAY
Establish.

 REAR OF SHERIFF STATION - DAY
A large blackboard is set up behind the station. Special
Agent Dale Cooper is writing a list on the blackboard with
chalk, consulting his electronic notebook. A small table is
set up near the blackboard, covered with the fruits of Lucy's
morning doughnut run. Four folding chairs are set up near the
table.
Sheriff HARRY S. TRUMAN is using a tape measure to calculate
the distance from a line drawn on the ground in front of the
blackboard to a large nearby rock. LUCY MORAN is holding the
end of the tape measure on the line, eating a donut. Deputy
Hawk is placing an empty pop bottle on a marked flat spot on
top of the rock.
Deputy ANDY BRENNAN is gathering small, round rocks into a
galvanized metal bucket. They all carry mugs of coffee that
read, "Twin Peaks Sheriff's Department."
COOPER
(thinks of something,
flips on recorder)
Diane, 8:17, quick note: definition
of a Chinese word, "Koro," that's
the name of Mrs. Josie Packard's
dog, mixed breed. I believe the
word is Mandarin, I'm sure I know
what it means but I can't lay my
hands on it.
Truman reaches the spot on the rock with the tape and calls
back...
TRUMAN
Exactly sixty feet, six inches.
COOPER
Perfect.
Cooper bites into a doughnut. At the rock, Hawk whispers to
the Sheriff...
15.
HAWK
What do you think he's up to?
TRUMAN
Beats me.
HAWK
Sixty feet, six inches; that's the
distance from home plate to the
pitcher's mound.
TRUMAN
Kinda interesting, huh?
HAWK
Yeah.
Truman starts back, re-spooling the tape measure. Andy shows
Cooper the bucket of rocks.
ANDY
Where would you like these rocks?
COOPER
Set 'em down by the donuts, Deputy.
Andy does. Lucy picks up a coffee pot.
LUCY
Would anyone like a warm-up?
EVERYONE
(severally)
Yes, please... thanks... you bet...
COOPER
Damn good coffee.
(sips, burns his tongue)
...and hot. Would everyone please
take a seat?
Truman, Hawk, Andy and Lucy sit on the four folding chairs.
Cooper takes a telescoping pointer out of his coat pocket and
expands it full length.
COOPER (CONT'D)
By way of explaining what we've
been doing and are about to do, I'm
going to first talk to you a little
bit about the country called Tibet.
16.
Cooper flips the two-sided blackboard over, revealing a
detailed map of Tibet and surrounding countries tacked to the
back.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Tibet is bordered on the southeast
by Burma, on the south by India and
Nepal, on the west by India and
Kashmir and on the north and east
by China. It is almost completely
surrounded by mountain ranges. An
extremely spiritual country,
practicing a form of Buddhism known
as Tibetan Buddhism, for many
centuries the leader of Tibet has
been known as the Dalai Lama; upon
the death of each Dalai Lama, his
spirit is believed to pass into the
body of a newborn infant. An
exacting series of test are
performed to discover this boy's
identity, who is then rigorously
trained to fulfill his great
responsibilities.
The Sheriff's Department is intrigued, but completely
mystified.
COOPER (CONT'D)
In 1950, Communist China invaded
Tibet and while leaving the Dalai
Lama nominally in charge, they in
fact seized control of the entire
country. Following a Tibetan
uprising against the Chinese in
1959, the Dalai Lama was forced to
flee for his life to India, and has
lived in exile ever since.
Cooper collapses his expanding pointer.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Following a dream I had three years
ago, I have become deeply moved by
the plight of the Tibetan people,
and have been filled with a desire
to help them.
Cooper flips the blackboard back over. The Sheriff's
Department members look at each other just a tad uneasily.
17.
COOPER (CONT'D)
I also awoke from this dream
realizing that I had subconsciously
gained knowledge of a certain
deductive technique, involving mindbody coordination operating hand-inhand with the deepest levels of
intuition. Sheriff, Deputy Hawk, if
I could have your assistance I will
be happy to demonstrate this
technique...
Truman and Hawk look at the other, look at each other, and
stand. Cooper expands his pointer again.
COOPER (CONT'D)
You'll recall that on the day of
her death, Laura Palmer wrote in
her diary the following entry...
Points to where this line is written along the top left side
of the blackboard...
COOPER (CONT'D)
"Nervous about meeting "J."
tonight." Remember also that under
the nail on the ring finger of
Laura's left hand we discovered the
letter...
Points to where this is written on the top right side of the
blackboard.
COOPER (CONT'D)
"R." In addition, under the nail on
the ring finger of the left hand of
Theresa Banks, the girl who was
murdered last year, we discovered
the letter "T."
He writes the letter "T" next to the "R."
COOPER (CONT'D)
Today, however, we are going to
concentrate on the "J's." Harry, if
you would, when I give the word,
would you please read aloud each of
the names we've written on the
blackboard, all of whom had a
direct connection with Laura
Palmer.
18.
TRUMAN
Okay... alright.
COOPER
Deputy Hawk, if you would hold this
bucket of rocks up near me where I
can get at them... and would you
please wear kitchen mittens.
HAWK
(looks at Truman, who
nods)
Yes, sir.
Hawk puts on a pair of kitchen mittens and picks up the
bucket of rocks.
COOPER
Deputy Andy, would you please move
down near the bottle and stand by--
Andy rises and runs towards the distant rock, only too happy
to help.
COOPER (CONT'D)
(calling out)
Not too near!
Andy waves.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Lucy, would you please take the
chalk?
LUCY
(rises, takes the chalk
from Cooper)
I'm getting excited.
COOPER
And if I hit the bottle after
Sheriff Truman calls out a
particular name, make a check on
the board to the right of that name-
-Sheriff, I almost forgot, when you
say the name, also briefly
describe, if known, the person's
relationship to Laura Palmer--
ready?
EVERYONE
(severally)
All set... yes... yep...
19.
ANDY
Ready!
Cooper nods to Hawk, who holds up the bucket, then nods to
Truman.
TRUMAN
James Hurley...
(searches for a
description)
...secret boyfriend.
Cooper picks out a rock and holds it. He closes his eyes.
COOPER
James Hurley.
Cooper opens his eyes, winds up, and hurls the rock towards
the bottle. It strikes the larger rock well below the bottle.
Cooper nods at Truman.
TRUMAN
Josie Packard... was instructed in
English by Laura.
Cooper picks up a rock, closes his eyes.
COOPER
Josie Packard.
Cooper opens his eyes and lets it fly. It sails way above the
bottle, hits a tree and startles a bird that takes flight.
LUCY
So there's no check next to either
name?
COOPER
That's correct--next name, Sheriff.
TRUMAN
Dr. Lawrence Jacoby... Laura's
psychiatrist.
Cooper repeats the rock routine.
COOPER
Dr. Lawrence Jacoby.
Cooper throws again and hits the bottle. It falls off the
rock but doesn't break.
20.
LUCY
You did it, you hit it.
Lucy writes a check next to Jacoby's name.
COOPER
Lucy, make a note that the bottle
was struck but did not break--very
important--Andy, put the bottle
back in exactly the same spot.
Lucy and Andy follow directions. Cooper nods to Truman.
TRUMAN
Johnny Horne... Laura was his
special education tutor.
COOPER
Johnny Horne.
He throws and clanks a fifty-gallon trash can, under a
Douglas Fir.
TRUMAN
Norma Jennings... owns diner,
helped Laura organize the Meals on
Wheels charity program.
COOPER
Norma Jennings.
He throws and misses.
TRUMAN
Shelly Johnson... waitress at
diner, friend.
COOPER
Shelly Johnson.
Cooper throws it again; it ricochets off the large rock,
shoots up and wings Andy in the loaf.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Andy, I'm sorry --
LUCY
Sweetie?
ANDY
(immediately reassuring)
It didn't hurt, honest, it didn't
hurt a bit.
21.
TRUMAN
Where there's no sense, there's no
feeling.
They all laugh, including Andy.
COOPER
Sheriff, please continue.
TRUMAN
Joey Paulson... friend of James,
drove Donna to meet him.
COOPER
Joey Paulson. C
ooper opens his eyes, takes aim, throws, and misses. Lucy
takes a loud sip of coffee. Cooper nods to Truman again, who
is slightly confused by the next name on the blackboard.
TRUMAN
(doesn't know who this is)
Jack with One Eye...
COOPER
Jack with One Eye...
LUCY
There's no "i" in Jack.
COOPER
I think perhaps it means he only
has one eye.
(covers an eye)
HAWK
Sounds like Nadine, Big Ed Hurley's
wife.
TRUMAN
No, there's a casino up north
called One-Eyed Jack's.
COOPER
That's it--
TRUMAN
It's across the border on the
Canadian side.
COOPER
Sheriff, we're gonna have to check
that place out.
22.
TRUMAN
Sure, sure--
LUCY
Agent Cooper, I'm going to erase
this because it's a place, not a
person--
COOPER
Fine. Next name.
TRUMAN
It's the last one, Leo Johnson...
husband of Shelly, drives a truck,
connection to Laura... unknown.
He throws the rock, hits the bottle and breaks it.

 DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
NORMA JENNINGS is on the phone back in the kitchen.
NORMA
Shelly? It's Norma.
SHELLY
(trying to sound normal)
Oh hi, Norma, I was just about to
call you --
NORMA
Are you alright?
SHELLY
I'm fine, I'm fine, actually, I'm
not feeling to good, think I got a
touch of the flu--
NORMA
Shelly, didn't you have the flu
last week?
SHELLY
Norma, I'm okay... I just... can't
come in today.
NORMA
I'm worried about you.
23.
SHELLY
Thank you, Norma, I'll be fine, I
just need to rest.
NORMA
You want me to bring you anything?
SHELLY
No, no, I've got everything here I
need, but thanks anyway, I hope
you'll be okay down there. Heidi
should be able to work my shift,
she shouldn't mind too much, I know
she needs the money--
NORMA
Shelly, don't worry about it, you
work on getting better--
SHELLY
Norma, I know you always feel like
you have to drop by, but don't drop
by, I'm okay...
(she starts to get
tearful, hides it)
I'll see you later.
Shelly hangs up. Norma hangs up slowly and takes a sip from a
cup of coffee, thinking about Shelly. She turns to a small
television set on the counter behind her and turns up the
volume.
We MOVE in on the television screen in time to see...

THE TELEVISION
CLOSE on the set, as lush MUSIC swells over a robin's egg
blue background and we hear...
ANNOUNCER
(syrupy)
Each day brings a new beginning...
A beautiful, glowing white envelope is set down on the
background and a silk ribbon is effortlessly untied... a
folded white note is taken from the envelope...
ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
...and every holds the promise of
an...
24.
Violins soar as the note is opened and a scarlet red flowing
script writes out the program's title on the virgin white
paper...
ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
...INVITATION TO LOVE...

NORMA
As she pours herself a piping hot
refill, her eyes glued to the set.

THE TELEVISION
An establishing shot on the soap opera, a sign strung between
two towering Ponderosa pines that reads:
"THE PINES"
CAMERA pans down to a smaller sign that reads:
"SOUTH GATE"

SHELLY JOHNSON
In her living room, sitting uncomfortably on the edge of a
chair, sipping coffee, watching her television set...

THE TELEVISION
Under the "SOUTH GATE" signs, heavy iron gates swing open and
we...

 "INVITATION TO LOVE" SET #1 - "NIGHT"
A fake-classy elegant generic living room-dining room. A
beautiful, naughty looking redhead, EMERALD, bursts into the
room, steaming. She paces, picks up a silver cigarette box,
takes out a smoke, taps it angrily on the box and fires it up
with a two pound acrylic-glass-sculpture lighter. She exhales
an exasperated burst of smoke.
A nice-good-looking-but-ineffectual young man, CHET, follows
her into the room, carrying a highball.
25.
CHET
Emerald, please, listen to reason--
EMERALD
Reason? Reason? There's no reason--
CHET
Jared's your father--
EMERALD
And Melanie's my sister!
CHET
And she's my wife!
(she smokes)
Your father loves you, poor Jared,
he's been out of the hospital less
than a week--
EMERALD
Ha! He wasn't even sick.
CHET
Yes, but those pains were real. You
shouldn't have spoken that way to
Melanie, she was with him at the
hospital night and day, she was
exhausted when you spoke, she
didn't mean to hurt you--
:
SHELLY
Sipping her coffee, watching the
show hypnotically.

THE TELEVISION
As the show continues...
EMERALD
We'll see who's hurt... Chet,
you're a fool...
(she puts out her
cigarette in his drink)
And Melanie's a fool. And Jared's
the biggest fool of all.
MONTANA'S VOICE
(from offscreen)
So what does that make me?
26.
They both look towards a pair of open French doors leading
out to a patio... standing there is MONTANA, a big insolent
tough guy in t-shirt and leather jacket, a cigarette hanging
off his lip.
CHET
(stunned)
Montana...
EMERALD
(pause; a sly smile)
...I knew you'd be back.
MUSIC swells. Chet sweats. Montana scowls. Emerald sneers.
The set fades to black.

 ED HURLEY'S HOUSE - DAY
NADINE HURLEY watches, engrossed by the show on her
television...
ANNOUNCER
(from the TV set)
...INVITATION TO LOVE... will
return...
Commercial music in; Nadine, in workout gear, resumes
vigorously rowing on her rowing machine. Wearing an extremely
greasy gas station work shirt, his hands covered with
industrial strength grime, BIG ED HURLEY enters the front
door behind her, stops when he sees Nadine rowing away.
Ed tries to tiptoe around behind Nadine so she doesn't see
him and in doing so steps on a drape runner and a bag of
cotton balls laid out on the floor. He bends the drape
runner. Nadine stops rowing.
NADINE
Ed!
ED
Sorry, honey, I didn't see it there-
-
NADINE
What are you doing?
ED
I popped a grease cartridge, needed
to change my shirt--
27.
NADINE
You stepped on my drape runner--
ED
Nadine, honey, it's right out here
in the middle of the floor--
NADINE
You think that's an accident? I
laid it out there myself, I was up
all night working on that invention-
-I'm going to have the world's
first 100% quiet runner!
ED
I'm really sorry, Nadine--
NADINE
And why aren't you cleaning up at
the Gas Farm?
ED
Ran out of cleaner, honey, Spanky
knocked it over chasing a hubcap--
NADINE
Ed, you make me sick!
Ed nods and moves into the other room. Pumped up with rage,
Nadine re-grips the metal oars and pulls back on them; we
hear the screech of rending steel as the oars bend back like
willow sticks.

NADINE'S TELEVISION
The soap continues; JARED, a distinguished looking character
of sixty, in smoking jacket and ascot, sits at a desk, tears
streaming down his face. He reaches out a shaking hand for...

 JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY
Shelly continues to watch the soap...

28.
SHELLY'S TELEVISION
...Jared's hand reaches toward a pistol, hovering above it.
Music. Fade out.

SHELLY
A sudden, loud knock on the door
startles her. She switches off the
set and moves to the door.
SHELLY (CONT'D)
Who is it?
BOBBY'S VOICE
Hey, baby, it's the big bad bobcat--
SHELLY
Are you crazy? What are you doing
here?
BOBBY'S VOICE
I just passed Leo, starting to
diesel up in North Bend, the
coast's clear, we got at least
twenty minutes, let me in--
SHELLY
Where's your car?
BOBBY'S VOICE
Parked in the woods, somebody might
see me out here and that'd be
worse.
She decides to partially open the door and speak to him,
keeping the bruised side of her face hidden.
SHELLY
Bobby, you can't come here like
this, we can't see each other for a
while--
He tries to kiss her, putting his arms around her, she
stiffens up in pain and he sees the bruises on her face.
BOBBY
What the hell happened to you?
SHELLY
Leo Johnson happened to me.
29.
BOBBY
That bastard!
SHELLY
I'm telling you, he's crazy, if he
finds out about us he'll kill you,
he'll kill us both--
BOBBY
If he ever does this to you again,
I'll kill him.
(she gets a twinkle in her
eye)
I mean it.
They kiss tenderly.
SHELLY
Bobby, you gotta go.
BOBBY
You call me soon as you can.
SHELLY
Alright, I'll try.
BOBBY
(winks)
Save it for me, baby.
Bobby moves off. Shelly closes the door.

 BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
Josie Packard looks out a window and sees...

 BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
Pete and Catherine get into Pete's car and drive off.

 BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
Josie moves away from the door, exits into a corridor...

30.
 BLUE PINE LODGE CORRIDOR - DAY
Josie moves down the corridor and enters another door...

 BLUE PINE LODGE OFFICE - DAY
Catherine's office. Leaving the door open, Josie moves behind
the desk. She searches for and finds a catch that releases a
latch...
...a false shelf of books hinge out from the wall, revealing
an old fashioned wall safe. Josie takes out the key that Pete
gave her and inserts it into the keyhole of the safe. She
manipulates the handle and opens the safe door.
Josie reaches into the safe and lifts out two sets of two
ledger books labeled: PACKARD SAWMILL, RECEIPTS; one set
labeled "1989" and the other "1990."
Josie hears a car drive up and brakes squeal outside.
CATHERINE'S VOICE
I told you to put it in the car--
Josie quickly puts the books back in the safe, closes the
safe, replaces the false bookshelf, and scurries out of the
room.

 BLUE PINE LODGE CORRIDOR/OFFICE - DAY
Just as Josie enters the corridor, Catherine comes up the
stairs to the corridor. Josie hurries back into the office
and hides in the closet.
CATHERINE
(to herself as she enters
the office)
I told that knothead twice to put
it in the car.
Catherine moves to the desk, looking for something, which she
finds. Josie watches from the closet as Catherine remembers
something, picks up a phone, punches in a number on the autodialer and waits.
CATHERINE (CONT'D)
Ben, Catherine... where the hell
were you last night? I thought we
had a date... family crisis?
31.
(MORE)
You want to see a family crisis,
try standing me up twice in a row,
Mr. Debonair.
She hangs up and exits. In the closet, waiting, Josie ponders
this information.
FADE OUT:

ACT THREE
FADE IN:
 CHURCH - DAY
A church bell rings. Citizens are leaving church.

 CHURCH - CLOSER - DAY
Doc Hayward pushes Mrs. Hayward in her wheelchair towards the
handicapped access ramp. Donna exits the church behind them
and sees Audrey Horne is standing outside, leaning against a
railing.
AUDREY
(to Donna)
Hi.
DONNA
Hi.
Something in Audrey's look says she wants to talk to Donna.
DONNA (CONT'D)
I'll be right there, Dad.
DR. HAYWARD
We're going over to get a Softie
Freeze, you'll be joining us, won't
you?
DONNA
Dad, when I have ever missed a
Softie Freeze?
MRS. HAYWARD
Maybe Audrey would like to join us?
AUDREY
Do you all go for a Softie Freeze
every Sunday?
DR. HAYWARD
Every Sunday after church since
Donna was a little girl.
MRS. HAYWARD
We enjoy is so much. Hope you can
join us.
Mrs. Hayward drives down the ramp.
33.
DR. HAYWARD
Nice to see you in church, Audrey.
Dr. Hayward follows his wife off.
AUDREY
(sincerely)
I wanted to come down cause of
Laura.
DONNA
What do you mean? I didn't think
you even liked her.
AUDREY
There were things about her I
didn't like, but she helped take
care of my brother. And I guess I
sort of loved her for that. That's
why I'm here.
DONNA
That's really nice of you.
AUDREY
I knew how close you were to her. I
wanted to tell you how sorry I am.
DONNA
Thanks.
Audrey nods, shyly, ready to move off.
AUDREY
You take care.
Donna starts to watch her go.
DONNA
(feeling Audrey's
loneliness)
Why don't you come with us for a
Softie Freeze?
AUDREY
I don't know...
DONNA
Really.
AUDREY
(touched)
Yeah?
34.
DONNA
Sure, come on, they're really good.
AUDREY
Okay.
DONNA
And if we're really lucky, maybe my
dad will tell his story about the
night the porcupine got into the
hospital.
AUDREY
Oh, I'd like to hear about that.
They walk off together towards the parking lot.

 SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
Re-establish.

 SHERIFF'S STATION RECEPTION AREA - DAY
Three men in black suits, hats and sunglasses enter the
building, each carrying a stainless steel suitcase. The point
man is ALBERT ROSENFIELD, a brilliant, mannerless FBI
forensics expert, the others are his ASSISTANTS. Lucy looks
up from behind the reception window.
ALBERT
(abruptly)
Tell Agent Cooper that Albert and
his team are here.
LUCY
Albert?
ALBERT
Are we going to have to stand here
all afternoon?
LUCY
No.
ALBERT
Albert. Albert Rosenfield. Ro-senfield.
35.
LUCY
(punches into the
switchboard)
Sheriff, this is Lucy, is Agent
Cooper with you?
TRUMAN'S VOICE
(over the speaker)
Yes--
COOPER'S VOICE
(over the speaker)
Is Albert here, Lucy?
LUCY
(surprised)
Yes, he is.
COOPER'S VOICE
We're on our way.
LUCY
(to Albert)
Agent Cooper will be right with
you.
ALBERT
(takes out a cigarette)
I can hear perfectly well.
One of his Associates lights his cigarette. None of them see
Lucy stick out her tongue at Albert.

 SHERIFF STATION CORRIDOR - DAY
As Cooper and Truman move towards the reception area.
COOPER
Harry, just so you know, Albert and
his team are the cream of the crop--
TRUMAN
If they're working for you, I
wouldn't expect anything less.
COOPER
Albert's a forensics genius, but I
should warn you he's lacking in
some of the social niceties.
36.
TRUMAN
Nobody's perfect.
COOPER
Isn't that the truth?
They turn a corner and come upon Albert and his team.
ALBERT
What the hell kind of a two-bit
operation are they running out of
this tree house, Agent Cooper?
COOPER
Albert, this is Sheriff Truman.
ALBERT
I have seen some slipshod backwater
burgs in my time, but this place
takes the cake.
Truman gives an astonished look at Cooper, who gestures "see
what I mean?"
ALBERT (CONT'D)
What are you waiting for, paint to
dry? We've got work to do, damn it,
they're putting the girl in the
ground tomorrow, half the day's
wasted traveling out here to the
middle of nowhere--
COOPER
(keeps his cool; knows
Albert well)
Albert, I suggest you and the
fellas go to work.
TRUMAN
I'll have one of my men escort you
to the morgue and we'll take one of
your men up to the crime site.
COOPER
(hands him a file)
Results from the pathologist's
autopsy.
ALBERT
(scans it scornfully)
Welcome to Amateur Hour.
(to his men)
Looks like an all-nighter.
37.
They pick up their suitcases. Truman holds the door open for
them.
TRUMAN
(as Albert passes)
I hear you're good at what you do.
ALBERT
Correct.
TRUMAN
That's good, because normally if a
stranger came into my station
talking this kind of crap, he'd
walk out wearing his teeth for a
charm bracelet.
Albert and Truman look eye-to-eye. Albert blinks first, puts
on his shades, and heads out. His men follow. Truman looks at
Cooper, who winks at him.

 DOUBLE R DINER - EVENING
Establish.

 DINER - EVENING
Norma's brewing a new pot of coffee, when Ed Hurley walks in
and takes a seat at the counter. With a fair number of other
customers scattered about, Ed and Norma interact discreetly
as she pours him a cup of coffee.
NORMA
Fresh pot.
ED
I could use it.
NORMA
Hard day?
ED
They don't get any easier. How
'bout you?
NORMA
Had a girl sick today. Double
shift. Been on my feet since
breakfast.
38.
ED
So much for a day off.
NORMA
Got an appointment with Hank's
parole officer in the morning.
ED
What's that all about?
NORMA
Don't know. Guess I'll find out.
ED
When Hank's hearing?
NORMA
Tuesday.
They not to show their fear to each other. A CUSTOMER sits
down at the counter next to Ed. Norma hands him a menu and
moves away. Ed rises, put a buck on the counter, gives a
Norma a thumbs up as he heads out.

 ED HURLEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Ed enters, quietly, moves into the living room. He stops when
he hears moans and cries of exertion coming from another
room; it sounds like someone's making love.
Ed moves to the doorway, slowly opens the door...
...and discovers the cries are Nadine's, who's doing bench
presses on a weight bench with what looks like an enormous
amount of weight.
Ed moves away from the door.
NADINE'S VOICE
Ed? That you?
ED
It's me.
We hear the sound of the huge weight clang to the floor and
Nadine hurries into the room, flushed with excitement.
NADINE
Ed... Ed, I'm so happy, sweetheart,
I have to thank you.
39.
She embraces him, hugs him alarmingly hard.
ED
Why's that?
She looks up at him, her eyes wide and bright.
NADINE
You don't know what you've done for
me.
ED
No, I don't.
NADINE
Ed, you big lug... when you tracked
all that grease in the house today,
you spilled some onto my cotton
balls, but instead of tossin' 'em
out I put the greased ones on my
runners--Ed, just listen to this...
She opens and closes the curtains: completely silent runners.
NADINE (CONT'D)
Completely silent...
ED
How 'bout that?
NADINE
(tears of joy in her eye)
Ed... we're going to be so rich.
She embraces him again. Ed pats her back, tries to
manufacture a smile.

 GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - NIGHT
Re-establish. The Sheriff's cruiser pulls up.

COOPER AND TRUMAN
As they sit in the cruiser, parting for the night, Cooper
consulting his notes, Truman making some of his own.
40.
COOPER
Tomorrow we interrogate the trucker
Leo Johnson and Dr. Lawrence
Jacoby...
TRUMAN
Right--
COOPER
We'll see what Albert and his team
have after examining Laura and the
abandoned train car.
TRUMAN
Right--funeral's tomorrow.
COOPER
Right. No change on the girl at the
hospital, Ronette--
TRUMAN
Still in a coma--
COOPER
Is it always this temperature at
night?
TRUMAN
This time of year.
COOPER
This is so pleasant. And the
humidity's so low. In Philadelphia
sometimes you get a heaviness in
the air like wet flannel pajamas.
TRUMAN
Why do you think they call it the
"Great Northwest?"
COOPER
Harry, you're preaching to the
convinced.
They shake hands.
COOPER (CONT'D)
You know where to find me.
TRUMAN
Yes, I do.
41.
Cooper gets out of the car.

 GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL BAR - NIGHT
Ben and Jerry Horne stand at the bar, nursing tall beers,
throwing cashews into the air and catching them in their
mouths. Passing by the door, Cooper sees them and enters the
bar.
COOPER
Mr. Horne?
Both Ben and Jerry turn towards him.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Mr. Horne?
BENJAMIN
Agent Cooper, I presume.
(they shake hands)
COOPER
FBI.
BENJAMIN
This is my brother Jerry.
JERRY
(shakes hands)
Happy to make your acquaintance.
COOPER
I must say, this is one handsome
and comfortable hotel you have
here, gentlemen.
BENJAMIN
Thank you. We aim to please.
COOPER
Do you get a lot of the vacation
dollar up this way?
BENJAMIN
Yes we do, but of course never as
much as one would like.
JERRY
Nothing a large resort wouldn't
fix.
42.
COOPER
A large resort. Is that Jerry with
a "J"?
JERRY
Yes it is.
COOPER
I believe I've met your daughter,
Mr. Horne. What a charming and
attractive girl.
BENJAMIN
("are we talking about the
same person?")
...Audrey?
COOPER
You must be very proud. Well, I'll
say goodnight. Nice to have met you
both.
BENJAMIN
Sleep well.
COOPER
I will. The bed is almost exactly
to the right degree of firmness.
He's gone. The brothers look at each other: "what is with
this guy?"

 WOODS/ CAR - NIGHT
Bobby Briggs and MIKE NELSON pull up in Bobby's car next to a
stand of trees. Bobby kills the engine but the headlights
remain on. They look out at the woods.
MIKE
I don't see him.
BOBBY
He'll be here. Come on, back me up.
Bobby pops the glove compartment. Mike takes a switchblade
out, pockets it. Bobby grabs a flashlight. They step out of
the car.

43.
 WOODS - NIGHT
Bobby and Mike walk slowly forward, Mike lagging a step or
two behind. They reach a particular tree with a large hollow
knot. Bobby reaches into the knot and pulls out a football.
MIKE
Is it there? It is in there?
Bobby kneels down and reaches into a slit cut across the top
of the hollow football. He pulls out a small packet of white
powder.
BOBBY
Not all of it.
LEO'S VOICE
Cash on delivery, Bobby.
They look up. LEO JOHNSON is standing between them and the
car, backlit by headlights, holding a shotgun.
BOBBY
(rises slowly)
Hey, Leo.
MIKE
Hey.
LEO
Toss it over here, quarterback.
BOBBY
It's empty.
He tosses the football to Leo.
LEO
Is that right? Weren't you supposed
to leave something in there for me?
BOBBY
That's what we wanted to talk to
you about, man.
LEO
Half down, half on delivery. That's
the deal.
BOBBY
You haven't delivered. We already
gave you half.
(holds up the drugs)
44.
(MORE)
This is less than you owe us for
that--where's the rest?
LEO
Where's the rest of the money?
MIKE
There's a problem.
LEO
Problem?
BOBBY
Laura had the other half in a safe
deposit box.
LEO
You think you got problems?
BOBBY
We can get it, Leo, soon as things
settle down.
LEO
(advancing)
You owe me ten grand.
BOBBY
(backing off)
Okay. So we won't take delivery
until we get it for you--
LEO
Look at me--I look like a bank to
you?
BOBBY
Man, I can appreciate your concern,
but this thing with Laura, how'm I
supposed to anticipate a thing like
that?
LEO
Laura was a wild girl.
BOBBY
Tell me about it.
LEO
Maybe. Someday.
Leo's right next to Bobby, Mike behind him. Bobby and Mike
look at each other. Mike reaches into his pocket.
45.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
Without taking his eyes off Bobby, Leo slowly swivels the
shotgun around and trains it on Mike.
LEO (CONT'D)
Take your hand out of your pocket,
Mike.
Mike and Bobby look at each other. Bobby nods. Mike takes his
hand out.
BOBBY
What's your problem, Leo?
LEO
Problem? You want to know about
problems?
BOBBY
...Okay.
LEO
You go out on the road. You're
drivin'. Back and forth. Gone for
days. You get home and guess what?
BOBBY
What?
LEO
You find out your old lady's been
givin' it away.
BOBBY
Yeah?
LEO
Yeah. Steppin' out. In your own...
damn...
(loud whisper)
...bedroom...
Leo's eyes dart back and forth. Amphetamines. Bobby and Mike
look at each other.
LEO (CONT'D)
That's... a problem.
He cocks the gun.
BOBBY
I guess so. I guess it is. You know
who?
46.
LEO
A man needs a clean house.
BOBBY
Sure... so do you know who?
LEO
I will take care of it.
BOBBY
Sure you will... and this other
thing, hell, we'll take care of
that, too, don't you worry about
that. We'll get that cash and we'll
square everything--
LEO
Go out for a pass.
BOBBY
What?
LEO
Go out. Run. Run.
Bobby and Mike back away from him.
BOBBY
Leo, take it easy, okay?
LEO
Run!
Bobby and Mike turn and start jogging away from him, back
towards the car, picking up speed, glancing over their
shoulders.
MIKE
Oh God...
As he reaches the clearing where the car is parked, we hear a
primal scream from the woods behind him.
They turn as the scream dies away and they reach their car.
Something comes soaring up out of the woods and arcs down
towards them...
...the football thuds onto the hood of the car, scaring the
shit out of Mike and Bobby. They look at each other.
BOBBY
Let's get the hell out of here.
47.
They jump into the car and speed off into the night.
FADE OUT:

48.
ACT FOUR
FADE IN:
 GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Dale Cooper is undressing for bed. He sets his bedside travel
alarm clock, takes off his wristwatch and sets it down, picks
up his tape recorder.
COOPER
Diane, 1:18 a.m. Long day, turning
in. Albert and his team should have
something for us by morning. Run a
check for me on a Jerry Horne, Twin
Peaks businessman, Jerry with a
"j", h-o-r-n-e. Nothing specific.
Call it an instinct. Check that;
intuition. An instinct is when you
get hungry. Let's also get
background on a local psychiatrist,
Dr. Lawrence Jacoby, and wants-andwarrants on a truck driver, Leo
Johnson, also local. The air here
is fresh and crisp as a cracker;
you don't sleep, you slumber. Good
night, Diane.
He turns off the recorder, sets it down. Picks up a roll of
dental floss and tears off a string.

 PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT
Re-establish.

 PALMER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Leland is on the phone, sitting on the edge of the bed. Sarah
sits listlessly in a chair.
LELAND
(into the phone)
Yes... yes, Madelaine, dear, we'd
appreciate it a great deal... the
funeral's at two o'clock...
alright, we'll look for you around
noon... thank you, dear... drive
safely.
Leland hangs up, turns to Sarah.
49.
LELAND (CONT'D)
(gently)
Sarah?... Sarah?
Leland moves over to her and kneels down beside her, as she
turns towards him. During the following, he takes a pill from
a bottle, hands it to her, along with a glass of water.
LELAND (CONT'D)
Sarah, that was cousin Madelaine...
SARAH
(a little hazy)
...Donald's girl?
LELAND
That's right, niece Madelaine.
SARAH
...is she here?
LELAND
She's driving in, tomorrow. For the
service.
SARAH
Oh.
Silence. Sarah takes the pill, drinks.
SARAH (CONT'D)
I'm going to go downstairs for a
while.
LELAND
Alright.
A long pause before Sarah rises and slowly moves out of the
room. Leland fights back some tears. He takes a pill from the
bottle and swallows it.

 DALE COOPER'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Dale Cooper lies asleep in bed. We move in slowly on him...

 PALMER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
50.
NOTE: FROM THIS POINT TO THE LAST SCENE IS DALE COOPER'S
DREAM
Sarah Palmer sits on a couch, eyes
half-closed, fighting off
memories...
:
SARAH'S MEMORY - TIME DISTORTED
She moves up the stairs, the morning of the discovery of the
murder. She calls out Laura's name. She looks in her room.
She moves down the hall and calls again.
Sarah shifts uneasily on the couch...

 LAURA'S ROOM - SARAH'S POV - TIME DISTORTED
She enters Laura's room and looks one way, then another...
one way, then another...
Sarah opens her eyes in horror...
A FRIGHTENING MAN is crouched in the corner by the foot of
Laura's bed, clutching the brass rails. It's the same man
Sarah saw in her vision the previous day.
Sarah sits bolt upright and screams...
SARAH
LELAND! I SAW HIM! OH! OH!
 LELAND PALMER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Leland Palmer frantically dials the phone...
:
 LUCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Andy is playing "TAPS" on the trumpet. Lucy is sitting in a
chair hitting a ball attached by a string to a paddle. The
phone on the table beside her rings. She answers.
LUCY
Hello, Lucy Moran's residence, this
is Lucy...
LELAND
Lucy, Lucy!
51.
LUCY
Shh! Andy, shh! I'm trying to talk
on the telephone.
Andy stops playing.
LELAND
Lucy, this is Leland Palmer, I'm
trying to get in touch with the
Sheriff, Sheriff Truman, he's not
at home, can you tell me where he
is?
LUCY
You know, Mr. Palmer, I don't.
(puts hand over the phone,
shushes Andy, he stops
playing)
LELAND
Lucy, my wife has just remembered,
she believes she saw the killer,
this morning, in Laura's bedroom--
LUCY
No--how is that possible?
LELAND
I don't know, but she thinks with
someone's help, she could draw the
face that she remembers.
LUCY
Actually, Tommy "The Hawk" Hill is
our police sketch artist, he's very
good, the pictures look just like
the people he's drawing--
LELAND
Lucy, can you please get the
Sheriff and that Deputy over here
right away?
LUCY
Okay. You know, I've got an idea,
as soon as we hang up, I'm going to
try the Sheriff in his car, in his
cruiser, and tell him everything
you've told me--
LELAND
Thank you, Lucy.
52.
He hangs up, shaking his head. We stay with Lucy as she hangs
up and quickly punches in another number.
LUCY
(to Andy)
That was Mr. Palmer, he told me
that he thinks his wife remembers
that this morning, possibly when
she was in her daughter's room that
she saw the--
(leaving Andy hanging)
Hello, Sheriff?

INSERT  SHERIFF'S CRUISER - NIGHT
Truman answers the radio call.
TRUMAN
Yeah Lucy, what is it?
:
 LUCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Lucy is on the phone.
LUCY
Isn't it funny, I had a feeling
you'd be in your cruiser--Sheriff,
Mrs. Palmer was in her daughter's
room this morning and she just
remembered that--are you sitting
down, of course you are, you're
driving--she remembered that she--
saw--the--killer.
TRUMAN
You're kidding...
LUCY
And they want you and Hawk to go
over to their house, she wants Hawk
to make a sketch--
TRUMAN
I'll be right there--ten minutes.

53.
 GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Agent Dale Cooper lies in bed, sleeping fitfully, troubled by
a dream.

 HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
In shadow, a pay phone in the hospital corridor. A FIGURE
that we can't see picks up and dials the phone.
FIGURE'S VOICE
Agent Dale Cooper, please... wake
him...
:
 COOPER'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Woken from his troubled sleep, Cooper answers the phone.
COOPER
(answers the bedside
phone)
Agent Cooper...
FIGURE'S VOICE
Were you sleeping?
COOPER
Yes, who is this?
FIGURE'S VOICE
It's a strange night. There's
something in the air, can you feel
it?
(silence)
You know about Theresa Banks, the
pretty girl they found last
year?...
COOPER
Yes, I know about Theresa...
FIGURE'S VOICE
I know the man who did her... I
know about the stitches, with the
red thread... and there's more that
I think you'd enjoy hearing... I'm
at the hospital now.
54.
COOPER
I'm on my way.
He hangs up the phone, starts to get out of bed, and the
phone rings again.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Agent Cooper...
:
 LUCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Lucy is on the phone, Andy is nearby, listening.
LUCY
Hi, Agent Cooper, it's Lucy from
work?
COOPER
Are you still at work, Lucy?...
LUCY
No, Andy and I are over at my
place, Andy was playing the trumpet
and we were getting ready for bed
and do you know what happened?
COOPER
No, tell me --
(stay with Cooper; a long
answer)
Oh, oh, oh, uh-huh, okay, okay, I
understand... Lucy, tell the
Sheriff to get that sketch and meet
me at the hospital--I've just
received a phone call--
Back on Cooper as he hangs up, picks up his tape recorder and
speaks into it as he starts to dress.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Diane, woken from a sound sleep at
the Great Northern Hotel, room 315,
it's 2:24 am. Received two phone
calls, back to back; the first from
a man unknown to me who had certain
confidential information regarding
the Theresa Banks murder. I'm on my
way to meet him now. At the same
time, Mrs. Palmer apparently
remembered or had a vision of the
killer.
55.
(MORE)
The Sheriff is on his way to her
and will meet me afterwards. Diane,
when two separate events happen
simultaneously pertaining to the
same object of inquiry, we must
always pay strict attention.

 HOSPITAL - NIGHT
Andy stands in the doorway. The One-Armed Man stands in the
shadows of the room. Cooper and Truman, carrying two police
sketches, join Andy.
ANDY
He's unarmed. He wants to see you
and he wants to see you in this
particular room.
Truman and Cooper turn towards the man.
ONE-ARMED MAN
Don't turn on the overheads. The
fluorescents don't work. I think a
transformer's bad.
COOPER
We know that.
ONE-ARMED MAN
Yes. Wasn't Laura Palmer here
earlier? "Through the darkness of
futures past, the magician longs to
see. One chance out between two
worlds... fire, walk with me"... We
lived among the people. I think you
say, convenience store. We lived
above it. I mean it like it is,
like is sounds... my name is Mike.
His name is Bob.
COOPER
You were in an elevator here.
ONE-ARMED MAN
I was looking for Bob. He sometimes
works among the infirm, the injured
of the species. I was watching, Mr.
Cooper, for over a year. Waiting
for Bob to come out again. I've
known of your interests in the
results of his endeavors...
56.
COOPER (CONT'D)
(MORE)
I too have been touched by the
devilish one. Tattoo on the left
shoulder... oh, but when I saw the
face of God, I was changed. I took
the entire arm off.
Truman and Cooper look at each other.
TRUMAN
We'd like to show you a police
sketch of Bob, for verification.
ONE-ARMED MAN
Of course.
(Truman holds up a bogus
sketch)
No, no, that's not Bob.
(Truman holds up the
correct sketch)
That is Bob.
TRUMAN
(to Cooper)
That's the man Mrs. Palmer
identified.
COOPER
Where is Bob?
ONE-ARMED MAN
He's here. Right here. He's
downstairs, in the basement.

 HOSPITAL BASEMENT BOILER ROOM - NIGHT
Cooper and Truman enter the basement, guns drawn. KILLER BOB,
the frightening long-haired man, crouches over a circle of
candles on the far side of the room.
Bob's hand reaches in and sets down a half of a heart
necklace onto a pile of dirt in the center of the candles.
Truman and Cooper advance. Bob rises.
KILLER BOB
(strangely)
Hello. Welcome to the killer's
lair. Come down, I won't hurt you.
Come down... is Mike with you?
COOPER
No.
57.
ONE-ARMED MAN (CONT'D)
KILLER BOB
Oh, I so much wanted to sing with
him again. Mike? Mike, can you hear
me? "Heads up, tails up, running to
your scallywag Night falls, morning
calls, catch you with my Death
Bag."
TRUMAN
The letters? What were the letters
going to spell?
KILLER BOB
Robert. That's my proper name.
Theresa's was a "t."
COOPER
That's right.
Behind Cooper and Truman, unseen by them, Mike is coming up
behind them, a gun in his hand.
KILLER BOB
You may think I've gone insane. But
I promise, I will kill again!
MIKE
Ahh! Like Hell!!!
Mike runs up and fires his gun twice. Bob goes down, mortally
wounded. Mike clutches a pole and twists to the ground, in
agonizing sympathetic pain.
MIKE (CONT'D)
Bob... Bob, it hurts something
terrible... wait... wait till your
turn, Bob... oh Bob... wait till
your turn...
Mike dies. Truman takes his gun away. Cooper looks over at
the candles.
COOPER
Make a wish.
A breeze blows out the candles...

A title card reads: TWENTY-FIVE YEARS LATER
58.
 RED-DRAPED ROOM - DAY
A large, windowless, well-lit, sparsely furnished, red-draped
room. A table and three easy chairs. Dale Cooper, twentyfive years older, sits in one of the chairs. A LITTLE MAN,
three and a half feet tall, in a red suit, stands with his
back to Cooper, shaking violently. A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN
who looks exactly like Laura Palmer sits across from Cooper
in another easy chair.
The Little Man stops shaking, turns to Cooper and claps his
hands once.
LITTLE MAN
Let's rock!
The Little Man sits in a chair beside the beautiful woman.
The Little Man closes his eyes and rubs his hands slowly
together.
The Little Man holds hands with the Woman, they look at each
other, then look at Cooper, smiling enigmatically. The Little
Man rubs his hands slowly again; the shadow of a bird passes
above them.
Both the Little Man and the Woman's speech is oddly stilted.
We see sub-titles under them, with the correct words.
Throughout, Cooper sits still, watches, and listens.
LITTLE MAN (CONT'D)
I've got good news! That gum you
like is going to come back in
style. She's my cousin, but doesn't
she look almost exactly like Laura
Palmer?
COOPER
But it is Laura Palmer. Are you
Laura Palmer?
WOMAN
I feel like I know her, but
sometimes my arms bend back.
LITTLE MAN
She's filled with secrets. Where
we're from, the birds sing a pretty
song and there's always music in
the air.
Strange saxophone music filters into the air. The Little Man
hops off the chair and begins to dance a strange dance around
the table.
59.
The Woman rises, goes over, and gently kisses Cooper on the
mouth. She softly whispers something in his ear.

 COOPER'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Cooper shoots up out of his bed, waking from this strange and
disturbing dream. He fumbles for the phone and dials.
COOPER
Harry, it's Cooper, meet me for
breakfast, seven o'clock, here at
the hotel. I know who killed Laura
Palmer.
He hangs up.
FADE OUT:

ACT ONE
FADE IN:
 GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY
Morning breaks over the stately hotel.

 GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - DAY
DALE COOPER, at the corner table, takes a sip of coffee and
orders breakfast from waitress TRUDY.
COOPER
Shortstack of griddlecakes, maple
syrup, lightly heated and a slice
of ham. Nothing beats the taste of
maple syrup when it collides with
ham.
TRUDY
Griddlecakes, side a' ham. Warmup?
Cooper nods appreciatively. Trudy refills his cup, exits.
Cooper takes a sip, nearly hums with approval. Then looks up
to find AUDREY HORNE standing before him. Audrey smiles,
beautiful, rubs a little sleep out of her eyes.
AUDREY
Good morning, Colonel Cooper.
COOPER
Just Agent, Audrey. Special Agent.
AUDREY
(caressing the words)
Special Agent.
COOPER
Please. Sit down.
AUDREY
(unsure)
I'm in a hurry.
COOPER
For what?
She doesn't know what to say or do. So she offers a nervous
shrug instead.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Audrey, that perfume you're wearing
is incredible.
AUDREY
Do you really think so?
Cooper takes a pen from his pocket, hands it to her with a
napkin.
COOPER
Write your name down for me.
AUDREY
(eager)
Okay.
She takes the pen and writes carefully, hands it back to
Cooper. He looks at it.
COOPER
Audrey, there's something you'd
like to tell me.
AUDREY
(blushing)
There is?
Beat. All she wants is to be close to him. Cooper produces a
note from his pocket.
COOPER
You slipped this under my door
night before last.
AUDREY
I did?
Cooper nods. Audrey comes clean.
AUDREY (CONT'D)
I wanted to help you. For Laura.
COOPER
Were you and Laura friends?
AUDREY
(simply)
No.
(beat)
But I understand her. Better than
the rest.
2.
COOPER
What is "One-Eyed Jack's?"
AUDREY
It's a place up north. Men go
there.
COOPER
What about women?
AUDREY
(blushing again)
Women work there.
COOPER
Did Laura work there?
AUDREY
I don't know. Laura worked at my
father's department store.
COOPER
"Horne's?"
AUDREY
He named it after himself.
COOPER
(on to something)
Where at Horne's department store?
AUDREY
(she thinks)
At the perfume counter.
COOPER
(making the connection)
So did Ronette Pulaski.
AUDREY
(it must mean something)
Really?
Cooper looks up, sees SHERIFF TRUMAN and LUCY MORAN coming
towards him from the far end of the dining room. Cooper looks
at Audrey's writing.
COOPER
The right-ward slant in your
handwriting indicates a romantic
nature, Audrey. A heart that
yearns. Be careful.
3.
AUDREY
(a whisper)
I do?
COOPER
I'm going to have to ask you to
leave now.
AUDREY
(sees the Sheriff,
flustered)
Police business.
Cooper nods, winks. Audrey blushes, rises.
AUDREY (CONT'D)
Thank you for talking to me.
She leaves as Truman and Lucy reach the table, eager to hear
Cooper's news: the identity of Laura's killer. The Waitress
arrives with Cooper's breakfast.
COOPER
Two more coffees please.
(re: Audrey as she exits)
Pretty girl.
(back to Truman and Lucy)
Hungry? The griddlecakes are
outstanding.
TRUMAN
(sits; hushed, urgent)
Who killed Laura Palmer?
Truman and Lucy lean in, the suspense is killing them. Trudy
pours coffee for them, as Cooper takes a bite of griddlecake,
then, finally:
COOPER
Let me tell you about the dream I
had last night.
Truman nods at Lucy. She whips our a steno, pad and pencil.
TRUMAN
Tibet?
COOPER
No. You were there, Harry. And so
were you, Lucy. Do you have a
sketch artist?
4.
TRUMAN
Andy sketches from time to time.
COOPER
Interesting. I dreamed it was
Deputy Hawk. Find out if Sarah
Palmer has had any disturbing
dreams. If she has, there may be
important clues in her dreams as
well.
TRUMAN
Clues.
COOPER
My dream is a code waiting to be
broken. Break the code, solve the
crime.
LUCY
(writing, whispering)
Break the code, solve the crime.
COOPER
In my dream, Sarah Palmer saw her
daughter's killer crouched at the
foot of her bed. Hawk sketched a
picture of the killer. I got a
phone call from a one-armed man
named Mike. The killer's name was
Bob.
TRUMAN
Bob and Mike?
COOPER
Different Bob. Different Mike. They
lived above a convenience store.
Mike couldn't stand the killing any
longer so he cut off his own arm.
Bob vowed he would kill again. So
Mike shot him.
(takes another bite)
Do you know where dreams come from,
Harry?
TRUMAN
Not specifically.
5.
COOPER
(very happy)
Acetylcholine neurons fire high,
voltage impulses into the
forebrain. The impulses become
pictures, the pictures become your
dream. But no one knows why we
choose these particular pictures.
TRUMAN
Was that the end of your dream?
COOPER
(back to business)
Suddenly it was twenty-five years
later. I was old, sitting in a red
room. There was a midget in a red
suit and a beautiful young woman
who looked exactly like Laura
Palmer. The little man told me my
favorite gum was coming back in
style and didn't his cousin look
exactly like Laura Palmer?
TRUMAN
Which cousin?
COOPER
The beautiful girl. Sometimes her
arms bend back. She's filled with
secrets. Where they're from birds
sing a pretty song and there's
always music in the air. Then the
midget did a dance. Laura kissed me
on the mouth. And whispered the
killer's name in my ear.
TRUMAN
Who was it?
COOPER
I don't remember.
TRUMAN
Damn.
COOPER
Harry, our job is simple: break the
code, solve the crime.
Cooper finishes his pancakes.
6.
LUCY
(still fascinated)
What does the midget stand for?
COOPER
Just about everything, Lucy.
Just then: Sheriff Truman's walky-talky shrieks. He answers
it.
TRUMAN
Yeah... Uh-huh... Right away.
(turns it off)
That was Andy. There's a fight at
the morgue.
COOPER
(he knows why)
Albert.

 THE DOUBLE "R" DINER - DAY
Townsfolk finish breakfast, exit from the diner.

 THE DOUBLE "R" DINER - DAY
NORMA JENNINGS and PAROLE OFFICER WILSON MOONEY occupy a
booth in the back. Mooney sips coffee, notes Norma's good
looks with a roving eye. In mid-conversation:
MOONEY
...in short, your husband has been
a model prisoner, an inspiration to
guard and inmate alike. He greets
the day with a smile and confounds
adversity with a kind word. He's a
credit to his serial number.
Mooney says it with a little come-hither grin. Norma just
stares, takes a drag off her cigarette, ignores him. Mooney
is forced to continue:
MOONEY (CONT'D)
Hank's parole hearing is scheduled
for Wednesday. Barring unforeseen
circumstance, with your full
support before the board, he should
be released shortly thereafter. Any
questions?
7.
NORMA
No.
MOONEY
Comments?
NORMA
(biting her tongue)
No.
MOONEY
I'm sure Hank appreciates your
unwavering devotion.
(to file)
Now, I'll need to check some
information. You and Hank have been
married for...
NORMA
Since high school.
MOONEY
There are no children.
NORMA
I can't have any.
MOONEY
How would you characterize your
current relationship?
NORMA
What do you mean, Mr. Mooney?
MOONEY
Are you planning a divorce, Mrs.
Jennings?
NORMA
Not a divorce, no.
Mooney hears the qualification.
MOONEY
Will you help Hank find the job he
needs to effect a successful
parole?
NORMA
Yes.
MOONEY
How, exactly
8.
NORMA
I own the Double "R", Mr. Mooney.
A beat. Norma can't stand him and Mooney knows it. Still, he
presses on:
MOONEY
You're quite a girl, Norma. You
must get all kinds of Romeos in
here begging for favors. How do you
keep them from your door?
It's his last attempt. Norma knocks it out of the ballpark:
NORMA
I usually tell them my homicidally
jealous husband is doing three-tofive for manslaughter but expects
to become a productive member of
society real soon.
MOONEY
(all business)
Well. That should conclude our
session for today.
NORMA
Thank you.
MOONEY
No, no. Thank you, Mrs. Jennings--
Too late. Norma's already out of
the booth, stepping back to the
counter. Mooney picks up his file,
watches her leave him.
ANGLE ON COUNTER
A pale and wan SHELLY JOHNSON, newly arrived, sets her purse
beneath the cash register.
NORMA
I didn't expect you till after the
funeral.
SHELLY
I figured you could use some help.
Norma pauses, looks beneath the register. She can SEE
Shelly's purse, slightly open. And she can see a brand new
handgun inside it.
9.
NORMA
(lowers her voice)
Shelly, what're you doing with a
gun in your purse?
SHELLY
Nothin'.
NORMA
"Nothin'." Nobody does "nothin'"
with a gun.
SHELLY
I bought it. It's for protection.
Peace of mind, anyway. You know,
what happened to Laura.
NORMA
You'd be better off hiring a
lawyer.
SHELLY
I can't afford one.
NORMA
Well watch yourself. Understand?
Shelly nods, pouts. Norma cases up a little.
NORMA (CONT'D)
Careful you don't murder your
makeup.
Norma grins, slips off toward hungry customers.

 TWIN PEAKS MORGUE - DAY
SUDDENLY we are inside the Twin Peaks morgue in the midst of
a reeling argument. DOC HAYWARD squares off opposite ALBERT
ROSENFIELD, the impossibly rude pathologist. DEPUTY ANDY
BRENNAN stands to the side, mute, ineffectual. And BEN HORNE
physically separates the two men.
A white partition separates the men from the body of Laura
Palmer.
HAYWARD
I have never in my life met a man
with so little regard for human
frailty. Have you no compassion?!
10.
ALBERT
I've got compassion running out of
my nose, pal. I'm the Sultan of
Sentiment!
Horne pushes them apart. Hayward and Albert pause, red with
fury. Finally:
ALBERT (CONT'D)
"Doctor" Hayward--and I use the
term so loosely my gums are
flapping--I have traveled thousands
of miles, and apparently several
centuries to this forgotten
sinkhole in order to perform a
series of tests. I do not ask you
to understand them. I am not a
cruel man. I only ask you to get
the hell out of my way so I can
finish my work!!
HAYWARD
We are here to escort Laura
Palmer's body to the cemetery. If
you think, for one minute, that we
will leave here without her, you
are out of--
HORNE
All right all right all right. Dr.
Rosenfield. Please. You are not
dealing with the unsophisticated
here.
Albert rolls his eyes so hard they, nearly spin out of the
sockets.
HORNE (CONT'D)
(the high road)
Leland Palmer could not be with us
today. I have agreed to appear on
his behalf. And I know I speak for
all of us, the Palmer family
included, when I say that we
understand and appreciate the value
of your work. But, as their
representative, I must insist we
consider the feelings of the Palmer
family as well.
Deputy Andy clears his throat, figures he might assist:
11.
ANDY
Dr. Rosenferd, we just got to get
Laura's body to the funeral on
time.
Albert glares.
ALBERT
Did you speak?!
Andy wishes he was invisible. Albert turns calmly back to
Horne.
ALBERT (CONT'D)
Mr. Horne. I realize that your
position in this fair community
pretty well guarantees venality,
insincerity and a rather irritating
method of expressing yourself.
Stupidity, however, is not a
necessarily inherent trait, so
please listen carefully. You can
have a funeral any old time. Dig
hole, plant coffin. I, however,
cannot perform these tests next
year, next month, next week, or
tomorrow! I must perform them now.
So please, why don't you and the
rest of the Bumpkin Brigade return
to porch rockers and resume
whittling. I've got a lot of
cutting and pasting to do--
HAYWARD
That does it. I'm taking charge of
the body, you won't touch Laura
again from this moment on--
Hayward steps toward the partition, Albert grabs him by the
arm.
ALBERT
Nor so fast, Old-Timer--
They square off, ready to fight again. Horne tries pull them
apart. And, just in time, Agent Cooper and Sheriff Truman
step into the morgue, the fray.
COOPER
Gentlemen.
HAYWARD
Harry, thank God--
12.
ALBERT
Cooper, this mindless old fool is
obstructing a criminal
investigation. Cuff him.
HAYWARD
He won't release Laura's body for
the funeral, he's not human.
ALBERT
Certainly has a way with an insult
though.
TRUMAN
Hey that's enough.
ALBERT
Zip it, Squarejaw.
(to Cooper)
I do not suffer fools gladly. Fools
with badges, never. I want no
contact with this hulking boob--
TRUMAN
I've had about enough of your
insults.
Albert steps forward, grabs him by the lapels.
ALBERT
Oh yeah? Well I've had about enough
of morons and half-wits, cretins
and congenital idiots, dolts,
dunces, dullards, and dumbbells.
And you, Chowderhead, lummox with
badge and billy club, you, Sheriff
Yokel you blithering hayseed, you
have had enough of me!??
TRUMAN
(calm as ice)
Yes I have.
Truman levels Albert with a single punch to the jaw. Albert
tumbles backward onto his butt. A beat. Albert looks up at
Truman, shocked beyond measure. Cooper intervenes in a flash.
He turns to Truman, orders:
COOPER
Harry, wait in the car.
Truman starts to speak, sees the steel in Cooper's eyes. He
exits without a word.
13.
ALBERT
Oh well. That's nice. How
appropriate.
(gets to his feet, yells
after Truman)
The rustic sucker punch. Why not
gunplay? A hail of bullets would be
nice--
COOPER
That's enough. The Sheriff didn't
mean anything.
ALBERT
He hit me.
COOPER
Well. I'm sure he meant to do that.
Albert starts to rail, but Cooper shuts him up with a
gesture.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Albert, I want the girl's body
released to her family now. I want
to see your test results by noon.
Those are orders.
Albert weighs his options, nods assent, marches off. A tense
beat. Ben Horne clears his throat. Doc Hayward turns to
Cooper.
HAYWARD
Thank you, Agent Cooper.
Cooper nods. Hayward, Horne, and Andy follow Albert out of
the room. A beat. Cooper remains, looks at the white
partition. He steps toward it.
ANGLE ON PARTITION
Agent Cooper pauses for a moment. stares quietly at Laura
Palmer's body. HOLD ON Cooper. The sadness in his eyes.
FADE OUT:

14.
ACT TWO
FADE IN:
 LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY
Truman and Cooper pull up to the Johnson house, park the
cruiser next to Leo's truck rig. They step out of the
cruiser. Truman stops, deeply troubled about the morgue
altercation.
TRUMAN
I can't believe I decked him. It
was out of line, it was
unprofessional, it was probably
illegal.
COOPER
Harry, there are many ways to
handle an insult. But sometimes
there's just no substitute for a
stiff right hook.
TRUMAN
Tell me I'm not going to get my
butt kicked by the Bureau.
COOPER
Albert's been hit before. He will
be hit again. You'll get your
buttkicked over my dead body.
(takes a deep breath,
enjoys)
Look at that, there's a duck on the
lake. Fill me in on Leo Johnson.
TRUMAN
Leo's one of those guys you keep on
your list and you keep an eye on,
but we've never caught him with his
hand in the cookie jar.
They turn a corner and come upon LEO JOHNSON, behind the
house, chopping wood. Leo glances at them, continues to chop
wood furiously. They advance.
COOPER
Excuse me. Leo Johnson?
LEO
Who the hell are you?
15.
TRUMAN
This is Special Agent Cooper of the
FBI, Leo. He'd like to ask you a
couple questions.
LEO
So?
TRUMAN
So behave.
Leo stops chopping, glares at Truman. But he just returns it.
Leo mutters, resumes chopping.
LEO
So ask.
COOPER
Leo. Is that short for Leonard?
LEO
That's a question?
COOPER
Did you know Laura Palmer?
LEO
No.
COOPER
How well did you know her?
LEO
I said I didn't.
COOPER
You're lying.
LEO
I knew who she was, all right?
Everybody did.
COOPER
Do you have a criminal record, Leo?
LEO
Nothing. You can look it up.
COOPER
(he already did)
A speeding ticket. April, 1986. A
second moving violation, illegal Uturn. September, 1988--
16.
LEO
I paid my debt to society.
COOPER
(beat)
Where were you the night of Laura
Palmer's murder? Around midnight.
LEO
(pleased with his alibi)
On the road. I called my wife
Shelly about that time. From Butte.
COOPER
She'll confirm that?
LEO
She will if you ask her.
Leo suddenly stops chopping, sticks the axe deep into the
wood. He looks at Cooper and Truman, unafraid. Cooper and
Truman look at each other.

"INVITATION TO LOVE" - "NIGHT"
START CLOSE on a television screen, lush MUSIC over a robin's
egg blue background, the familiar voice intoning:
ANNOUNCER
...and every hour holds the promise
of an... INVITATION TO LOVE...
FADE UP ON insolent tough guy MONTANA in t-shirt and leather
jacket. Luscious EMERALD eyeing him like a cool drink of
water. And ineffectual CHET.
EMERALD
So, Montana, did you find that
rainbow you were looking for?
MONTANA
Lots of rainbows. No pot of gold.
CHET
I'm not sure how I'm feeling about
this.
EMERALD
Chet, get Montana a drink. He must be thirsty after a year in
the rain forest.
17.
Emerald sashays across the living room, steps lightly into
Montana's arms. She offers him a welcome kiss--a little too
ardently for Chet's liking.
CHET
How long are you planning to stay,
Montana?
Montana looks up from Emerald's beestung lips.
MONTANA
Long enough to see my ex-wife; how
is Jade, Chet?
Chet shivers. The music swells.

 PALMER HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals a television in the Palmer house. A
NURSE turns her eyes from the screen, withdraws a syringe
from Leland Palmer's arm. She discards the empty, carefully
draws medication into a second syringe, and places it on a
tray. Just then: the doorbell RINGS.
STAY WITH Leland as the nurse walks to the front door. Leland
watches television.
:
"INVITATION TO LOVE"
JARED, distinguished in smoking jacket and ascot, weeps,
finishes a suicide note addressed to Emerald and Jade. He
takes a gun into his hands, lifts it slowly. Suddenly:
someone knocks at the door, calls to him.
JADE'S VOICE
Daddy! Open up! Daddy it's jade!
Jared pauses, looks at the door, the gun. Music swells.
DURING ABOVE, we HEAR the Palmer's front door open, some
muted exchange, two sets of footsteps returning to the living
room. Finally:
MADELEINE'S VOICE
Uncle Leland?
Leland looks up, sees the Nurse and MADELEINE FERGUSON
standing before him. Madeleine is twenty, quite beautiful,
She wear glasses, has jet black hair worn long.
18.
She sets down a suitcase. A closer angle REVEALS that she
looks very much like Laura Palmer.
Leland stares at Madeleine for a long beat. As if he didn't
recognize her. Then, with great difficulty:
LELAND
Madelaine?
(rises, steps closer,
takes her by the hands)
Maddy?
MADELEINE
Uncle Leland, I'm so sorry, I...
Madeleine pauses, a sob catches in her throat. She begins to
cry. Leland carefully wipes a tear from her deep blue eyes.
Madeleine looks up at him, whispers:
MADELEINE (CONT'D)
Oh Uncle Leland...
Leland takes her into a healing embrace. He's crying too.
HOLD ON them for a beat.

"INVITATION TO LOVE" - "NIGHT"
Jared holds the gun in his hands, listens to his daughter's
tearful pleading.
JADE
Daddy! Daddy please!
Finally, Jared sets the gun on his desk, steps to the door.
He opens it. And JADE, his beautiful, compassionate, perfect
daughter leaps into his arms. She is Emerald's twin.
JADE (CONT'D)
Oh Daddy. I was so afraid. I love
you Daddy.
HOLD on father and daughter for a beat.

 HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY
Establish.

19.
 HAYWARD HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY
Doc Hayward steps into the living room, dressed for the
funeral save for the tie which hangs undone around his neck.
Donna waits for him. She looks at his tie, manages a small
smile.
DONNA
Dad, you're hopeless.
Donna knots her father's tie. She does not speak. Her eyes
are red from crying. Hayward takes a look at his daughter,
consoles:
HAYWARD
Want to talk about it?
DONNA
Oh, Dad, I... I can't believe
they're burying Laura today. It's
so... final. I think and I think
and it just doesn't make sense.
HAYWARD
Death never does.
DONNA
(tearful)
So what are we supposed to do?
HAYWARD
(after a beat)
I live with death and dying every
day. There are times when it's
merciful, almost a relief. But
often it seems nothing but needless
and cruel. It made me furious, for
many years. Furious and helpless.
As you go through life, you learn
to accept it. Because we have to.
Even when it hurts bad enough to
break your heart.
DONNA
My heart is breaking. And I don't
know how to stop it.
Donna looks up at her father. Her eyes are bright with tears.
Father and daughter embrace.

20.
 BRIGGS HOUSE - DAY
Establish.

 BRIGGS DINING ROOM - DAY
BOBBY BRIGGS sits at the dining room table, smoking a
cigarette. Quiet, seemingly downcast. But his eyes are angry
and cold. He wears dark funeral clothes, a tie. Bobby turns,
finds MAJOR BRIGGS standing across the room.
MAJOR BRIGGS
Robert, this may be a good time for
a brief discussion.
BOBBY
You want to talk about cigarettes?
Today?
MAJOR BRIGGS
No. But put it out. It's a filthy
habit, especially for a varsity
athlete.
Bobby grinds out the cigarette in an ashtray. He glowers.
Major Briggs sits next to him, places a hand on Bobby's knee.
He means well, but physical affection does not come naturally
to him. It feels a little forced.
MAJOR BRIGGS (CONT'D)
I've attended my share of funerals.
Too many. Any man who dies in war
dies too soon. Laura died too soon
as well.
BOBBY
Yeah. She did.
MAJOR BRIGGS
But we have a responsibility to the
dead, Robert. Responsibility is the
linchpin that binds our society
together. Each man responsible for
his actions, each action
contributing to the greater good.
BOBBY
What's the good of putting somebody
in the ground?
21.
MAJOR BRIGGS
It is man's way of achieving
closure. In ceremony begins
understanding, and the will to
carry on without those we must
leave behind. And Robert, in your
life, you must learn, will learn,
to carry on without them.
BOBBY
(whispered)
Great.
MAJOR BRIGGS
I know you experience a certain
reluctance to enter fully into
meaningful exchange. That leads to
stalemate, and a desire on my part
to force certain wisdom upon you.
That's not necessarily a bad thing,
sometimes it is the best course
available.
Briggs pauses, rethinks. Then, a direct emotional
statement...
MAJOR BRIGGS (CONT'D)
Son. Don't be afraid. We'll all be
there together.
Bobby takes a closer look at his father. These are words he
understands. But they have absolutely nothing to do with the
way he's feeling.
BOBBY
Afraid of what?
MAJOR BRIGGS
The funeral.
BOBBY
I'm not afraid of any damn funeral.
Afraid? I can hardly wait. Afraid?
I'm gonna turn it upside--down.
The anger pours out of him. For once Major Briggs is
speechless. But no matter, just then BETTY BRIGGS steps into
the room, and, with a too bright smile...
BETTY
Everybody ready?
22.
Father and son turn jaundiced eyes her way.

 TWIN PEAKS POLICE STATION - DAY
Establish.

 POLICE STATION RECEPTION AREA - DAY
Cooper and Sheriff Truman step through the station reception
area. DEPUTY TOMMY THE HAWK appears, keeps pace beside them.
COOPER
Deputy Hawk.
HAWK
Agent Cooper. No sign of the man
with one arm.
COOPER
Keep trying, Deputy. He's out there
somewhere.
Cooper and Truman continue towards the conference room.
TRUMAN
If anyone can find him, Hawk can.
COOPER
Tracker?
TRUMAN
The best.

 INTERROGATION ROOM A - DAY
Cooper and Truman enter. Albert Rosenfield sits at the table,
with a huge file of test results. He refuses to acknowledge
Truman's presence. Not even a glare.
COOPER
Okay, Albert, what've you got?
ALBERT
Enough evidence to save your butt
and get mine out of this
godforsaken berg.
23.
COOPER
We're all ears.
Albert considers hurling an insult, instead tosses a glassine
envelope on the table.
ALBERT
Contents of envelope found in
Palmer diary. Cocaine. Toxicology
results also positive. The little
lady had a habit.
(throws a second envelope)
Fibers of twine embedded in her
wrists and upper arms. Two
different kinds of twine.
(another envelope)
Fibers of twine found in the
railroad car, a match to the sample
from the wrist. The same twine was
used to bind the wrists of the
Pulaski girl. My conclusion, she
was tied up twice at different
locations on the night of her
death. Once here.
(he points to his wrists)
Once here. Like this.
He gestures to his upper arms, pulls them back into an
uncomfortable position. Like in Cooper's dream.
COOPER
(quietly)
Sometimes my arms bend back.
Truman glances at him, intrigued. Albert reveals another
glassine.
ALBERT
Traces of pumice in standing water
outside the railroad car,
suggesting soap. The kind used for
heavy cleaning. Same pumice
particles appear on the back of
Laura's neck. Not her home-use
brand. My conclusion: the killer
washed his hands and leaned in for
a kiss... like this.
He demonstrates. Truman is disturbed by the implication.
TRUMAN
Lord...
24.
Albert shows them a photo.
ALBERT
Distinctive wounds on Laura's
shoulders and neck. Appear to be
claw marks, bites of some kind.
TRUMAN
An animal?
ALBERT
It's trying to think. How qua
Cooper silences Albert with a stern look. Albert produces
another envelope.
ALBERT (CONT'D)
A small plastic fragment from her
stomach, partially dissolved by
digestive acids. I'm taking it with
me back to the lab for
reconstruction, as the local
facilities give new meaning to the
word 'primitive.'
(closes the file with some
fanfare)
Those are the highlights. I'm not
entirely displeased, but a couple
more days with the body and who
knows what I might have come up
with--
COOPER
Good work, Albert.
Just then, Deputy Andy enters, dressed in funeral blues.
ANDY
Sheriff. Time to go?
COOPER
Albert, you'll excuse us. We've got
to get to a funeral.
Truman and Andy head out. Cooper moves to follow. But Albert
calls after him:
ALBERT
Cooper? May I have a word with you?
Alone?
Cooper nods to Truman and Andy. They exit. Albert pulls out a
document.
25.
ALBERT (CONT'D)
One more item.
(he slides it across the
table)
A report concerning the physical
assault on my person which you
witnessed this morning. I think
you'll find it accurate. It
requires your signature.
Cooper reads through the report with amazing speed. A beat,
then:
COOPER
Albert, I'm not going to sign this--
ALBERT
(shocked)
What?
COOPER
Albert, I hope you can hear this.
I've only been in Twin Peaks a
short time. But in that time, I
have seen decency, honor, and
dignity. I have seen grief to break
your heart. Murder is not a
faceless event here. It's not a
statistic to be tallied up at the
end of every day. Laura Palmer's
death has affected each and every
man, woman, and child. Because life
has meaning here. Every life. And
that's a way of living I thought
had vanished from this earth. It
hasn't, Albert. It's right here in
Twin Peaks.
ALBERT
Sounds like you've been snacking on
some of the local mushrooms.
Cooper sets the report on the table, carefully pushes it back
to Albert.
COOPER
With your behavior towards these
good people, count yourself lucky I
don't file a report of my own that
could bury you so deep in a
building in Washington you'll never
see the sun.
26.
Albert turns pale, collects his papers, exits without another
word. Cooper looks out the window, produces his miniature
tape recorder, speaks into it.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Diane, it's 12:27 PM. I'd like you
to check into my pension plan
options regarding outside real
estate investment. I'm thinking of
purchasing some property at what I
assume will be a very reasonable
price.
Cooper stops recording, pauses to ponder.
FADE OUT:

27.
ACT THREE
FADE IN:
 BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - DAY
OPEN ON a lovely smalltown cemetery, the usual weathered
headstones. ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Laura Palmer's burial site.
The freshly dug grave. A hydraulic frame used to lower the
casket. And two WORKERS testing the hydraulics, one sitting
on the coffin bed, the other raising and lowering it.

 BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - DAY
A gleaming hearse in the cemetery parking lot. A mortician
supervises the unloading of Laura's casket, for transfer to
the grave. MUSIC over.

 ED HURLEY'S HOUSE - DAY
Establish.

 ED HURLEY'S HOUSE - DAY
ED HURLEY steps into the living room wearing an ill-fitting
dark suit. He takes but three strides before Nadine appears
in a flurry, leaps into his arms. She nearly knocks him off
his feet. Ed endures an embrace of lengthy duration, Nadine
snuffling about his ear. Finally, she steps back, beaming,
out of her mind:
NADINE
Love me?
ED
(wildly uncertain)
Why sure, Nadine.
NADINE
How do I look?
Nadine's wearing a faded black dress. Her idea of funeral
clothes. The buttons are incorrectly fastened. Ed looks at
the dress, Nadine's manic smile.
ED
You look fine, Nadine.
28.
NADINE
Last night was wonderful, Ed. You
came back to me. Now we're together
again. Not that we weren't, but now
I feel like we're really together.
Nadine leaps back into his arms. Ed receives her with stunned
expression.
NADINE (CONT'D)
At high school, I used to watch
Norma and you at those football
games? She was so pretty. You were
such a handsome couple, but I knew,
I always knew once you got to know
me that we'd be together. Even
though I was just a little nobody,
a little brown mouse, I was always
hoping... and wasn't I right?
Wasn't I right?
Nadine pauses, the memories come and go. She looks up at Ed,
back in the moment:
NADINE (CONT'D)
Do you remember?
Nadine's mind spins and shifts, it's slowly slipping away.
And Ed doesn't know what the hell to do about it. So he
reaches out to her, carefully redoes the top two buttons on
her dress. Nadine's got them reversed.
ED
(gently)
Sure, Nadine. I remember.
NADINE
(smiles, a blank)
What's that?
Just then: the sound of a motorcycle outside. Not knowing
what else to do, Ed goes to the window.
ED
James.
A beat. James enters. But he's wearing jeans and a leather
jacket. Ed frowns.
ED (CONT'D)
You ready? I don't want to be late.
29.
JAMES
I'm not going.
ED
What do you mean you're not going.
It's Laura.
JAMES
I'm not going. I can't.
ED
James--
Too late. James turns and walks out the door. Big Ed makes no
move to follow.

 GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY
Establish. A limousine waits our front.

 GREAT NORTHERN CORRIDOR - DAY
Dressed for the funeral, Audrey moves down a corridor in the
hotel residence wing, STOPS to peak into...
:
AUDREY'S POV -  BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
JOHNNIE HORNE sits on the floor, attired in an expensive
suit. DR. LAWRENCE JACOBY kneels at his feet, whispers
urgently to the boy, trying to convince him to remove the
familiar Indian headdress.
Audrey watches from outside the doorway, listens to Jacoby
whisper and cajole. She can see tears glistening in the
doctor's eyes.

 BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - DAY
A flowered trellis stands at the entrance from the parking
lot to the burial grounds. The LOG LADY arrives wearing a
surprisingly appropriate funeral dress, clutching her log to
her breast.
30.
She steps among mourners as they emerge from automobiles.
Cooper, Sheriff Truman, and Deputies Andy and Hawk get out of
the police cruiser, join the throng.

 BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - DAY
Mourners step through the trellis into the cemetery proper.
Doc Hayward escorts Donna onto the green grass, she pauses,
sees Mike waiting for her nearby.
MIKE
Hi.
DONNA
(to father)
Just a sec.
Donna steps away from her father, walks to Mike. She looks at
him, says nothing. An awkward beat, then:
MIKE
Hey. I'm sorry about the other
night. I didn't mean anything.
(reaches for her, she
pulls away)
Hey, I said I was sorry...
DONNA
I don't want to see you anymore,
Mike. Please don't bother me again.
Mike watches, shellshocked, as she walks away.

 BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - DAY
Ed escorts Nadine through the cemetery. He sees Donna
returning to her father.
ED
Go on ahead, Nadine. I'll catch up.
Nadine seems uneasy, a little lost.
ED (CONT'D)
I promise. It'll be fine.
Nadine nods, reassured, moves off. Ed steps toward Donna,
intercepts.
31.
ED (CONT'D)
Hello, Donna.
DONNA
Where's...?
ED
He's not coming. He wouldn't.
DONNA
Why?
Ed can only shrug. Donna sees her father waiting, there's no
rime to talk. She's upset, tries to hide it and walks on.
NORMA'S VOICE
Ed?
Ed turns, finds Norma standing behind him. She's troubled.
NORMA
Hi.
ED
(an uneasy glance around)
Not the best place to talk.
NORMA
I know. Hank's parole hearing is
tomorrow. He could be out next
week. Maybe sooner.
Ed nods. He doesn't want to talk about it here. She sees
Nadine standing nearby and realizes why.
NORMA (CONT'D)
(not catty)
Nadine looks nice.
ED
Yeah. She's feeling good today.
There's sympathy in his voice, sadness too. Norma
understands. Ed manages a smile and moves off.

 BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - DAY
Lastly, Ben Horne escorts Leland and SARAH PALMER into the
cemetery. Mourners stop and stare. Sarah squints in the
sunlight, clutches Leland's hand. And Madeleine Ferguson
walks behind them, wearing dark glasses.
32.
Ben spots Catherine nearby. He nods to Madeleine, allows her
to escort Leland and Sarah ahead. Ben remains, waits for
Catherine to join him.
CATHERINE
(as they walk, aside)
Taking care of the Palmers, are we?
BEN
It's the only decent thing to do.
CATHERINE
Had to shut down the mill again.
All that grief. 'Few more tragedies
it'll roll over and play dead.
BEN
See you at the funeral.
Ben and Catherine separate, poker-faced.

 LAURA'S GRAVESITE - DAY
Mourners gather around the grave. Laura's burnished casket
sits on its hydraulic bed, the dark hole beneath it. And
FATHER CLARENCE prepares his oration. Father Clarence is an
old man, red-faced; he fumbles with a number of prayer books
and hymnals. This is no ordinary service for him. He is as
deeply saddened as those who wait for him to comfort them.
FATHER CLARENCE
I am the resurrection and the life,
saith the Lord; he that believeth
in me, though he were dead, yet
shall he live; and whosoever liveth
and believeth in me shall never
die.
In the distance, a lone figure steps through headstones
toward the grave. James Hurley. He walks closer, eyes locked
on Laura's casket. Bobby sees him coming, darkens, scowls.
Donna sees James too. She finds Bobby in the throng, notes
his fury. And so begins, as Father Clarence continues, a
CHAIN OF GLANCES.
CLARENCE'S VOICE
For none of us liveth to himself,
and no man dieth to himself. For if
we live, we live unto the Lord; and
if we die, we die unto the Lord.
33.
Donna looks to Sheriff Truman for help.
But Sheriff Truman is looking at Josie.
Josie meets his gaze. Then looks away, as if too shy to stare
at him here.
Josie turns to Pete Martell. Pete nods, ever sociable.
CLARENCE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
(over glances)
Whether we live, therefore, or die,
we are the Lord's. Blessed are the
dead who die in the Lord; even so
saith the Spirit, for they rest
from their labors. The Lord be with
you...
ALL
And with thy spirit.
CLARENCE'S VOICE
Let us pray.
Pete turns from Josie, looks to his wife.
But Catherine is leering at Ben Horne.
Ben returns her gaze, but is jostled by Bobby shoving past
him toward the grave.
CLARENCE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
God, entrust this child Laura to
thy never-failing care and love,
and bring us all to thy heavenly
kingdom; through the same thy Son
Jesus Christ our Lord, who liveth
and reigneth with thee and the Holy
Spirit, one God, now and forever.
Amen.
Father Clarence clears his throat. But before he can
continue, Johnny Home brays out a rather ill-timed:
JOHNNY
Amen!
FATHER CLARENCE
Thank you, Johnny.
34.
THE CHAIN OF GLANCES CONTINUES:
Shelly spots Bobby, sees his anger, follows his stare to
James.
James is looking at Donna, seeking comfort, approval.
But Donna, having witnessed Bobby's fury, now looks to Big Ed
for help.
CLARENCE'S VOICE
I baptized Laura Palmer. I
instructed her in Sunday school.
And like all of you, I came to love
her with that special love we
reserve for the headstrong and
bold. Laura was bright, beautiful,
charming. But most of all she was,
I think, impatient. Impatient for
her life to begin, for the rest of
the world to catch up with her many
dreams and ambitions.
Big Ed doesn't notice Donna's distress. He's busy trying to
get Norma's attention.
Norma doesn't see him. She's looking at Nadine.
Nadine, oblivious as always, is gazing intently at Leland and
Sarah Palmer, Madeleine beside them. Nadine wipes tears from
her eye.
CLARENCE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
If we appear to put those dreams to
rest today, do not believe it. For
those of us who loved her, those
dreams will never die. They live on
inside each of us.
JOHNNY'S VOICE
(as ill-timed as before)
Amen!
Madeleine looks up, sees Nadine peering at her from across
the grave.
Madeleine looks away, only to find Audrey staring at her from
the other side.
Audrey notes the resemblance to Laura, reacts.
Audrey looks to find Agent Cooper in the throng, she wants
him to see it too.
35.
And as for Cooper, he's been watching this chain from the
start, fascinated by all the connections and clues it offers
him.
Suddenly Cooper frowns. He sees Bobby Briggs plowing through
the crowd, stepping quickly toward Father Clarence, the
grave.
CLARENCE'S VOICE
Laura used to tell me that I talked
too much. I won't make that mistake
here. It is enough to say that I
loved her, and will miss her for
the rest of my days.
JOHNNYS VOICE
(getting into his own call
and response rhythm)
Amen!!
Bobby steps to the front of the gravesite, nearly howls the
repetition:
BOBBY
AMEN!!!
Everything stops. Bobby confronts the grave and the gathered
mourners with grief and rage.
BOBBY (CONT'D)
What are you looking at? What are
you waiting for? You make me sick.
You damn hypocrites make me sick.
Everybody knew she was in trouble.
But we didn't do a thing. Who
killed the Prom Queen?! You did. We
all did. And pretty words won't
bring her back. Keep your prayers.
Laura doesn't need them. She
would've laughed at them anyway
Bobby's cracking up, tears pool in his eyes. James moves to
stop him. Mike hurries forward, ready to fight. Bobby sees
James approaching, he leaps in his direction.
But Cooper gets there first, Truman, Andy, and Hawk close
behind. They pull the boys apart, stop the fight before it
happens. Amidst the shouting and commotion, Johnny Horne
lifts his head toward the sky, lets out an atavistic howl:
JOHNNY
Ahoooooooooooh!!
36.
Audrey rushes to comfort him. The howl, the brawl, all
contribute to a growing sense of chaos, trouble and grief in
the air. Major Briggs grabs his son and drags him away from
the grave as Bobby screams at James:
BOBBY
I'll get you! You're dead! I'll get
you!
And now, unnoticed for the moment, Leland Palmer lets go of
his wife's hand, steps quietly toward the casket. He stares
at it for a long beat, the tumult erupting all around him.
Then, quite suddenly, without warning...
Leland Palmer leaps onto the casket, shouting and wailing...
LELAND
Laura! Laura!
Gasps of shock. Truman and Cooper step forward immediately,
but Leland's jump has activated the hydraulics, the casket
begins to sink from view. A CARETAKER frantically reverses
the controls, brings Leland and the casket up again. But just
as Truman and Cooper seem about to grab him, the casket
begins to descend, remains beyond their grasp.
LELAND (CONT'D)
Laura! My baby! And so it goes, the
casket rising and falling, Truman
and Cooper now enlisting the
deputies to form a human chain, the
mourners reacting with shock and
dismay. And now, at long last,
Sarah Palmer takes tentative steps
forward, her eyes seem to clear,
and she shouts, roars at her
husband:
SARAH
DON'T RUIN THIS TOO!!
A sudden silence descends upon the gravesite. Sarah Palmer
remains frozen, Madeleine at her side. Mourners glance at
each other, begin to disperse. The funeral of Laura Palmer
has concluded.
FADE OUT:

37.
ACT FOUR
FADE IN:
 DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT
Nightfall at the Double R.

 DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT
OPEN ON a pair of hands, female, acting out a pantomime on
the Double R counter. One hand, palm down, held out straight,
suggests a coffin/platform. The other, two fingers pointed
down, skips across the counter, suggesting leaping feet. In
this manner, accompanied by buzzing lips approximating the
sound of hydraulics, Shelly Johnson reenacts the funeral
imbroglio. Her fingers skip across the counter, leap upon the
coffin, and BZZZZZ, the hydraulics go up and down and up and
down...
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Shelly in the Double R. She's
entertaining several old coots at the counter, demonstrating
Leland Palmer's leap onto the casket--and into local lore.
Norma passes by, frowns.
Shelly puts her hands behind her back as if to promise no
more finger puppets. But the moment Norma moves on, she's at
it again, fingers flying, lips buzzing, much to the delight
of the crusty old regulars.

 DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT
Sheriff Truman, Big Ed Hurley, and Deputy Hawk share a booth
in the back, drinking coffee and eating pie. They speak just
above a whisper. They're trading secrets, not funeral gossip.
In mid-conversation:
TRUMAN
Maybe we should tell him.
HAWK
Why?
TRUMAN
I feel bad keeping him in the dark.
What the hell, he's going to figure
it our sooner or later anyway.
ED
Don't be so sure.
38.
TRUMAN
(looking over Ed's
shoulder)
Want to bet?
Truman SEES Cooper enter the diner, step toward their booth.
TRUMAN (CONT'D)
Right on time.
ED
(sotto voce)
Careful who you trust, Harry. He's
not one of us.
COOPER
Evening, Harry. Ed, Hawk.
Truman gestures to the space beside him. Cooper sits down.
COOPER (CONT'D)
I got your note. What's up?
Ed signals to Norma, she steps over to take Cooper's order.
TRUMAN
Agent Cooper, how would you like
some fresh huckleberry pie?
COOPER
I would love some huckleberry pie.
(for Norma's benefit)
Heated. Vanilla ice cream on the
side. Coffee.
NORMA
Coming right up.
Norma steps away. Cooper turns to Ed.
COOPER
How long have you been in love with
Norma?
Ed blanches, says nothing. Truman turns to him.
TRUMAN
See what I mean?
Ed nods. Cooper takes note of the exchange, looks to Hawk,
Sheriff Truman.
39.
COOPER
There's something you fellas want
to tell me.
ED
(a convert)
Better tell him.
Hawk nods assent. A beat. Sheriff Truman begins:
TRUMAN
Someone's running drugs into Twin
Peaks from over the border. We've
been working undercover, trying to
set up a bust: top to bottom.
Nobody walks.
COOPER
Who's targeted?
TRUMAN
Jacques Renault, bartender at the
Roadhouse, we figure him for the
middleman. Ed was staking him out
the night you got into town.
Renault slipped something into his
drink.
ED
Felt like somebody hit me on the
head with a hammer.
COOPER
I didn't know you were a deputy,
Ed.
TRUMAN
He's not.
COOPER
A little outside your jurisdiction,
isn't it?
ED
Somebody's sellin' drugs to high
school kids. That's in everybody's
jurisdiction.
TRUMAN
I call on Ed when I need him. He's
not the only one I call.
Just then: Norma arrives with Cooper's pie and coffee.
40.
TRUMAN (CONT'D)
Thank you, Norma.
NORMA
Enjoy.
Cooper digs in, gives Norma a hearty thumbs-up. Norma smiles,
walks away.
COOPER
This must be where pies go when
they die.
Cooper takes another bite. Sheriff Truman waits for some
reaction to all he's told him. Finally, Cooper sets down his
fork, begins:
COOPER (CONT'D)
Someone's bringing, drugs into Twin
Peaks. Laura Palmer was on drugs.
You call on Ed to help you out.
Ed's a good man. Local bartender's
a mid- level player, okay, it's
hard to get by on minimum wage. Now
Harry, please. What is it you
really want to tell me?
Sheriff Truman looks at the others. They encourage him to
continue
TRUMAN
You're going to have to trust me.
No matter how it sounds.
COOPER
I trust you, Harry.
TRUMAN
(after a beat, looking for
words)
Twin Peaks is different. A long way
from the world. You've noticed
that.
COOPER
Indeed I have.
TRUMAN
And that's the way we like it. But
there's a back end to that that's
different too. Maybe that's the
price we pay for all the good
things.
41.
COOPER
What is it?
TRUMAN
(lowering his voice)
There's a sort of evil out there.
Something strange in the hills. It
takes different forms, but it's
been there for as long as anyone
can remember. And we've always been
here to fight it.
COOPER
"We?"
TRUMAN
Men before us. Men before them.
More after we're gone. We protect
our own. We have to.
COOPER
(relishing this)
A secret society.
The others exchange looks.
TRUMAN
Let's take Agent Cooper for a
little ride.
COOPER
Where to?
TRUMAN
The Book House.

 THE ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
A dusty parking lot surrounds the slightly seedy honky tonk.
Behind it, another, smaller structure. The Book House.
Sheriff Truman and the others arrive in a cruiser and a
patrol car, exit. Cooper takes a deep breath of cool night
air.
TRUMAN
This way.
Truman leads Cooper towards the Book House.
42.
COOPER
How long have you been Sheriff,
Harry?
TRUMAN
Five years.
COOPER
How long have you been meeting
here?
TRUMAN
Longer than that.
(they, reach the door)
It's a funny thing. Seems like
every time you solve a mystery,
there's another one right behind
it.
Cooper smiles. He can appreciate that sort of thinking.

 BOOK HOUSE NIGHT
They enter. It is a clubhouse of sorts, chairs and tables, a
comfortable atmosphere. And walls lined with bookshelves,
tomes on every imaginable topic. Cooper stops, reacts.
There's a burly hirsute MAN, wearing a gag, tied to a chair
at the center of the room. James Hurley and JOEY PAULSON
stand guard.
TRUMAN
You know James. Joey Paulson.
JAMES
Hello, Agent Cooper.
COOPER
Hello, James. Joey. Who's this?
TRUMAN
Bernard Renault. Jacques' brother.
Janitor had at the roadhouse.
Bernard had an ounce of cocaine in
his kit bag. Thought we'd ask him a
couple questions.
Cooper nods, getting into the spirit. Truman removes
Bernard's gag.
43.
COOPER
(after a beat)
Did you ever sell drugs to Laura
Palmer?
BERNARD
(French-Canadian)
I don't sell drugs.
TRUMAN
How much does Jacques pay you to be
the mule?
BERNARD
Jacques don't pay me nothing, I'm
no mule.
TRUMAN
So that ounce we found, that was
for personal use?
BERNARD
That's right.
TRUMAN
Where's your brother been? Not at
work the last few days.
BERNARD
I don't know. He got business.
COOPER
With who?
BERNARD
I don't know.
TRUMAN
Who else does Jacques work with?
BERNARD
Why don't you ask him yourself? He
be back tonight. Any minute.
TRUMAN
He's coming to work?
BERNARD
(stating the obvious)
He the bartender, isn't he?
Bernard grins, triumphant. Cooper looks at Truman, steps
closer.
44.
COOPER
Bernard, we have you tied up in a
chair. You're mixed up in a wide
variety of felonies with your
brother. What I want to know is,
why in the world would you tell us
when and where to find him?
That wipes the grin off his face. Bernard looks at his feet,
says nothing. Cooper doesn't mind. He already knows the
answer.

 COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
JACQUES RENAULT walks down a country road, peers through the
dark at the Roadhouse in the distance. Jacques stops
suddenly, reacts.
JACQUES' POV - THE ROADHOUSE
There's a redlight on top of the honky-tonk, it shines and
blinks a warning. Jacques takes one look at it, knows what it
means. He turns and runs as fast as he can in the opposite
direction.

 LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Leo stands over the kitchen sink, carefully cleans and
polishes a pair of heavy boots. The phone rings. Leo sets the
boots on a towel, answers it.
LEO
Yeah?
:
 PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT
Jacques is calling from a phone booth, breathless, sweating
from the run.
JACQUES
The bust light's on. Bernard's in
trouble.
LEO
You sure?
45.
JACQUES
I saw it. You gotta get me out of
here, Leo. Border run.
LEO
Where are you?
JACQUES
Phone booth by the Cash and Carry.
I don't like waitin', man.
LEO
Shut up. I'm on my way.
Leo hangs up, grabs his jacket and a small bag. Shelly
enters, wonders.
SHELLY
Where you goin'?
LEO
You don't need to know.
He exits. Shelly grabs her purse, kneels down in the kitchen
near a cabinet. Without hesitation--she's done this before--
Shelly carefully removes some of the cabinet's slats,
revealing a hiding place. She reaches into the hole, pulls
out Leo's bloody shirt. Satisfied, she returns it, then digs
into her purse, removes her brand new Colt .32, looks at it
for a beat. Then puts it with the shirt below and replaces
the slats.

 ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
Cooper, Truman, Ed, and Hawk exit, Truman heads for his
cruiser, gets on the radio.
TRUMAN
(to Cooper)
You and Hawk wait inside the
Roadhouse. Ed and I'll watch the
road, I'll call for some back-up.
COOPER
Jacques' half-way to the border by
now.
TRUMAN
We don't know that yet.
46.
Cooper directs their attention to the blinking red light on
top of the Roadhouse.
COOPER
I don't remember seeing that
blinking red light before, do you?
The others look up. Truman realizes what's up. Hangs up his
radio.
TRUMAN
I'll take Bernard in and book him.
ED
I'll give you a hand, Harry.
TRUMAN
Hawk, why don't you run Agent
Cooper back to the Great Northern?
COOPER
(as they start off)
Buy you a drink, Hawk?
Hawk nods.

 GREAT NORTHERN BAR - NIGHT
A short time later. A sad song plays on a jukebox. Couples
gather on the small dance floor, a few GUESTS mingle at the
bar. Cooper and Hawk sit at small table near the fireplace.
Their mood is quiet, contemplative. It's been a long day.
COOPER
(after a beat)
Did you know her, Hawk?
HAWK
Laura? Caught her speeding a couple
times. Let her talk me our of the
ticket. That wasn't hard.
COOPER
Laura Palmer didn't have to die.
It's wrong. It makes me mad.
HAWK
Everything dies.
A beat. Cooper takes a pull from a longneck beer. He quietly
wonders:
47.
COOPER
Do you believe in the soul?
The question takes Hawk by surprise. He takes a closer look
at Cooper.
HAWK
Several.
COOPER
(curious)
More than one?
HAWK
Blackfeet legend. Waking souls that
give life to mind and body. A dream
soul that wanders.
COOPER
Where does it wander?
HAWK
Faraway places. The Land of the
Dead.
COOPER
Is that where Laura is?
HAWK
Laura's in the ground, Agent
Cooper. That's all I know for sure.
Cooper reacts, takes a closer look. Tommy 'The Hawk' Hill,
agnostic Blackfoot. There's more to him than meets the eye. A
beat. Cooper lifts his glass into the air, proposes a toast:
COOPER
To Laura. Godspeed.
They touch glasses, toast. That's when Cooper sees Leland
Palmer stepping between tables to the dance floor.
ON LELAND
Leland walks onto the dance floor, stands quite still. The
juke selects another title. Big band music pours into the
room. Leland listens intently. He looks up, his eyes bright
with tears. A beat. Leland Palmer begins to dance.
At first his actions go unnoticed. But gradually couples turn
to regard him, this sad man dancing across the floor. Some
giggle, others look with sympathy. Most begin to disperse.
But Leland keeps dancing, he pleads With those who remain:
48.
LELAND
Dance with me. Please. Dance with
me.
As his pleadings grows more desperate, Cooper and Hawk step
quickly to the dance floor, mean to lead him away.
COOPER
Mr. Palmer. Leland?
HAWK
Mr. Palmer?
Gradually, Leland hears them, finally focusing on them.
COOPER
It's time to go home.
Pause. He nods weakly, Cooper and Hawk gently lead Leland
between them out of the room.

 BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT.
Establish. A full moon sailing overhead.

 BLUE PINE LODGE KITCHEN - NIGHT
Lights are low, a small table has been set with silver,
candies, and white linen. A romantic supper for two. Josie
wears a silk robe, something sheer beneath it. Sheriff Truman
wears the ardent expression of a man in love.
Pete steps into view carrying dinner on a large platter.
PETE
Pan-fried Rainbow. Caught 'em this
morning.
Pete serves the trout to each.
JOSIE
Thank you, Pete.
PETE
It's nothing. Old family recipe.
Truman pours a little wine, offers:
49.
TRUMAN
Pour you a glass, Pete?
PETE
No, no. You kids enjoy. Never mind
the dishes. We'll get 'em later.
He intends to leave them alone. Truman smiles appreciatively,
thanks Pete with a wink. He watches Pete step from the room.
A beat. Josie toys with her food, silent, preoccupied.
Something is troubling her. And Truman knows it.
TRUMAN
Heart a' gold, old Pete.
JOSIE
Yes, he is.
TRUMAN
Josie, what's wrong?
JOSIE
Nothing.
TRUMAN
'Nothing.'
Josie looks up from her dinner. Candlelight shimmers all
around her.
TRUMAN (CONT'D)
God you're beautiful.
Josie tries to smile. But her eyes are full of fear. Truman
leans closer.
TRUMAN (CONT'D)
Josie something's wrong, I want you
to tell me.
JOSIE
(after a beat)
They want to hurt me. I know they
do. Something horrible is going to
happen, Harry.
TRUMAN
Who? Who's going to hurt you?
JOSIE
Ben and Catherine.
50.
CAMERA MOVES from the table, finally REVEALS an intercom
speaker on the wall, nearly out of sight, a silent ear
listening.

 MARTELL BEDROOM - NIGHT
Catherine Martell sits at a small desk, car pressed close to
an intercom console/speaker. She manipulates the volume knob,
listening to every word they say.
JOSIE'S VOICE
Catherine keeps the mill account
books in her safe. Two books. Two
accounts.
TRUMAN'S VOICE
(alert)
Two? Can you show me?

 BLUE PINE LODGE OFFICE - NIGHT
Josie leads Truman into the office, trips the hidden catch,
releases the false bookshelf, and reveals the wall safe. She
inserts the key, tugs at the handle.
JOSIE
Why would she keep two sets of
books?
TRUMAN
The usual reasons would have
something to do with stealing.
Maybe more.
Josie opens the safe, both look inside, react. There is only
one ledger inside.
JOSIE
But there were two.
Truman removes the ledger, thumbs through it.
TRUMAN
Nothing unusual here.
51.
JOSIE
(whispered, trembling)
There were two.

 MARTELL BEDROOM - NIGHT
Catherine smiles. She's holding the other ledger in her hand.
Just then: footsteps, Pete enters. She slips the ledger in a
drawer and turns down the intercom. Pete catches this last
action.
PETE
(all innocence)
Have you seen my tackle box?
CATHERINE
The next time you and the merry
widow want a peek in my safe, don't
go to so much trouble. Be a man
about it, Pete. Ask me to my face.
Pete stares at her for a beat. He'll fight another day.
PETE
Maybe I'll check the truck.
Pete exits. Catherine gloats.

 BLUE PINE LODGE KITCHEN - NIGHT
Truman and Josie sit before the wood-burning stove. Josie
burrows into Truman's arms, shivers, speaks just above a
whisper, revealing her deepest fears:
JOSIE
When Andrew died I was so alone. I
couldn't think, I didn't know what
to do. Catherine said she would
help me. And Ben would help me too.
TRUMAN
(figuring)
Ben and Catherine...
JOSIE
They lied to me. They didn't care
about Andrew. They didn't care
about me. All they want is to take
the mill away from me.
52.
(MORE)
(beat)
I have never said this before to
anyone. Harry, I believe Andrew's
death was not an accident. And I
believe they will try to kill me
too.
A tear runs from her eye. Truman pulls her closer, trying to
make some sense of this.
TRUMAN
Josie, Josie. Nothing's going to
happen to you. Not now, not ever.
I'll make damn sure of that.
JOSIE
Oh, Harry.
Truman kisses her gently. Josie sighs, returns his kiss with
greater fervor. They settle into a long embrace, whisper
between kisses.
TRUMAN
You don't have to be afraid.
Josie places her head against his chest, holds on tight.
TRUMAN (CONT'D)
(softly continues)
Days like today, death feels like
the biggest thing in the world. But
it's not, Josie. Nor for us.
JOSIE
I'm not afraid of death. I'm afraid
of losing you.
A beat. Josie begins to recite while trembling in his arms:
JOSIE (CONT'D)
All things howsoever they flourish
Return to the root from which they
grew. This return to the root is
called Quietness; Quietness is
called submission to Fate; What has
submitted to Fate has become part
of the always- so. To know the
always-so is to be Illumined; Not
to know it, means to go blindly to
disaster.
(beat)
He who knows the always-so has room
in him for everything;
53.
JOSIE (CONT'D)
(MORE)
He who has room in him for
everything is without prejudice. To
be without prejudice is to be
kingly; To be kingly is to be of
heaven; To be of heaven is to be in
Tao. Tao is forever and he that
posssess it, Though his body
ceases, is not destroyed.
HOLD ON Josie for a beat. Safe in Truman's arms.

 BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - NIGHT
Cooper stands watch at the cemetery, a night wind howling
about him. He peers into the dark, Laura's grave in the
distance. The Land of the Dead. A beat, then:
CARETAKER'S VOICE
Can you hear 'em?
Cooper turns to find an old CARETAKER at his side, gazing out
into the night.
CARETAKER
It's the metal and the wood, I
guess. Some caskets, you stick 'em
in the ground, and the wood starts
to expand, starts to rub against
that metal. And if it rubs just so,
you get a strange sort of sound. If
the night's just right, and the
wood--teak and brass are the best--
well, it's like music. You can
almost hear the caskets singin'.
Needless to say, it's a notion Cooper finds fascinating.

 BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - NIGHT
Minutes later. CAMERA STARTS AT GROUND LEVEL, green grass,
dark graves. Suddenly Cooper LOWERS INTO FRAME, presses his
ear to the ground. As if to listen for the casket's singing.
That's when he hears another sound. Footsteps, someone
walking toward Laura Palmer's grave.
Cooper slips into the shadows. He watches a lone figure step
to Laura's grave. But he can't make out the face. At least
until the mystery man lights a cigarette.
54.
JOSIE (CONT'D)
COOPER'S POV
It is Dr. Lawrence Jacoby. He inhales deeply, stares down at
Laura's grave. He holds a bouquet of flowers in his free
hand.

 BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - NIGHT
Jacoby sets the flowers by the headstone. Cooper steps into
view, speaks gently.
COOPER
Dr. Jacoby?
(silence)
I didn't see you at the funeral.
A long beat. Jacoby finally turns to Cooper, seems to notice
him for the first time. Then, eyes bright with tears, he
whispers:
JACOBY
I'm a terrible person, Agent
Cooper. I pretend that I'm not. But
I am.
Cooper says nothing. He'll let the man talk.
JACOBY (CONT'D)
I listen to their problems all day.
I give them advice, solutions that
are supposed to "improve" their
lives. These people think of me as
a friend.
(beat)
But the truth is, I... I don't
really care. When I'm not working I
wear ear plugs so I don't have to
hear them talk. Nothing... ever...
touches me.
(beat)
Except for Laura.
(beat)
I couldn't come today. I just
couldn't.
(a whisper)
I hope she'll understand...
HOLD ON them for a beat. Jacoby's sad tears in the dark.
FADE OUT:
55.

               FADE IN:

                THE PALMER HOUSE MORNING

               Establish.

                                                                    

                PALMER'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

               The homecoming photograph of Laura Palmer sits on a table 
               next to the sofa.

               We see a SKETCH PAD, a portrait of a frightening man, with 
               long, filthy hair. Deputy ANDY BRENNAN sits on the sofa making 
               the sketch. SARAH PALMER sits next to him, describing the 
               man in her vision in a tense whisper. Next to Sarah and 
               holding her hand is DONNA HAYWARD. Behind them stands SHERIFF 
               TRUMAN, studying Andy's work. On a chair beside the couch 
               DOC HAYWARD sits with medication at the ready.

                                     SARAH
                         His hair was long. Filthy grey on 
                         grey, long hair.

               MADELEINE FERGUSON appears quietly behind Truman with a tray 
               of coffee cups. She hands one to Truman and another cup to 
               Doc Hayward. She starts to place a cup in front of Sarah, 
               but with a gentle hand the doctor discourages this.

                                     SARAH
                              (struggling)
                         I saw him, by the foot of Laura's 
                         bed. He was like an animal.

               The scene is interrupted by a thump at the doorway. LELAND 
               PALMER totters in, unshaven.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Had you ever seen this man before?

                                     SARAH
                         No... never.

               Andy looks at Truman, who nods; Andy shows the sketch to 
               Sarah.

                                     SARAH
                         His face... oh, God, his face

               Sarah's head rocks back on to the top of the sofa. She's 
               starting to lose it.

                                     LELAND
                         Sarah? Have you told them about the 
                         necklace? They'll love that one.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Necklace?

                                     LELAND
                         She had two visions.
                              (winks at them)

                                     TRUMAN
                         Go ahead, Sarah.

               Leland rises and heads unsteadily out of the room.

                                     SARAH
                         It's night. A flashlight beam moves 
                         across the ground then a hand... a 
                         gloved hand... lifts a rock and takes 
                         out a necklace. Broken in half... it 
                         was Laura's...

               CAMERA MOVES IN on a frightened Donna.

                                                                    

               A TELEVISION

               Opening credits of Invitation to Love." Scarlet red flowing 
               script writes out the title.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         ...INVITATION TO LOVE...

                                                                    

                SHERIFF'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY

               Lucy sits at her desk glued to a small portable televison 
               set.

                                                                    

                                   "INVITATION TO LOVE"

               EMERALD, poured into a dress with a plunging neckline, slinks 
               toward CHET.

                                     EMERALD
                         Don't fight it, Chet.

                                     CHET
                         I'm still married to Jade. It's wrong.
                              (he turns away, 
                              struggling to control 
                              himself)
                         God... you're evil...

                                     EMERALD
                         For once in your life, Chet, you're 
                         exactly right.
                              (she takes Chet into 
                              a passionate kiss)
                         I want to see my father's will, Chet.
                              (another kiss. Chet 
                              melts)
                         Get it for me.

                                                                    

               LUCY

               Entering the station, Andy and Truman cruise up to her window.

                                     TRUMAN
                         'Morning, Lucy, what's going on?

                                     LUCY
                         Thanks to Jade, Jared decided not to 
                         kill himself and he's changed his 
                         will leaving the Towers to Jade 
                         instead of Emerald, but Emerald found 
                         out about it and now she's trying to 
                         seduce Chet to give her the new will 
                         so she can destroy it and Montana's 
                         planning to kill Jared at midnight 
                         so the Towers will belong to Emerald 
                         and Montana, but I think Emerald's 
                         going to doublecross him and he 
                         doesn't know it yet. Poor Chet.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What's going on... here.

                                     LUCY
                         Agent Cooper is in the conference 
                         room with Dr. Jacoby.

               Truman starts for the conference room. Andy hangs back to 
               talk to Lucy.

                                     ANDY
                         So I guess Chet's really got his 
                         hands full, huh?... Lucy, why couldn't 
                         I spend the night last night?

                                     LUCY
                         And will you be having coffee as 
                         well, Deputy Brennan?

                                                                    

                INTERROGATION ROOM A - DAY

               DR. JACOBY and AGENT DALE COOPER sit across the table from 
               each other. Jacoby plays idly with a golf ball, practicing 
               sleight-of-hand.

                                     COOPER
                         Was Laura Palmer seeing you because 
                         she was addicted to cocaine?

                                     JACOBY
                         I'd like to help you, Agent Cooper. 
                         Maybe there is some sort of hula we 
                         can do around my doctor-patient 
                         confidentiality.

               The blackboard from Episode Two stands behind Cooper. The 
               map of Tibet looks over Cooper's shoulder. Jacoby rises and 
               circles towards it. Truman enters. Cooper nods to him.

                                     COOPER
                         It is safe to say Laura came to see 
                         you because she had problems.

                                     JACOBY
                         Oh my yes.

                                     COOPER
                         Were her problems of a sexual nature?

                                     JACOBY
                         Agent Cooper, the problems of our 
                         entire society are of a sexual nature.
                              (studies the map)
                         Tibet. My abiding interests lie to 
                         the east as well, though only as far 
                         as Hawaii. Five years post-graduate 
                         work. There are sound solutions to 
                         our diseased family structures in 
                         native Hawaiian culture.

                                     COOPER
                         So there were problems at home.

                                     JACOBY
                         The ancient Hawaiians often turned 
                         to the soothing rhizome of the ginger 
                         plant to case the pain of profound 
                         confusion which, more often than 
                         not, was sexual.

                                     COOPER
                         Ginger is not addictive. Cocaine is.

                                     JACOBY
                         The fact that Laura Palmer sought 
                         medication, no matter how dubious, 
                         was actually a positive sign.

                                     COOPER
                              (frustrated)
                         Dr. Jacoby, I know that you cared 
                         deeply for Laura. Why won't you help 
                         us?

                                     JACOBY
                         I would like to. My own personal 
                         investigation, I suspect, will be 
                         ongoing for the rest of my life.
                              (not unaffected)
                         Laura had secrets. And around those 
                         secrets she built a fortress that in 
                         my six months with her I could not 
                         penetrate. For which I consider myself 
                         an abject failure.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Did she discuss Bobby Briggs and 
                         James Hurley?

                                     JACOBY
                         They were boys. Laura was a woman.

                                     COOPER
                         She had sex with three men the night 
                         she died. Were you one of them?

                                     JACOBY
                         No.

                                     COOPER
                              (bottom line)
                         Who killed her, Dr. Jacoby?

                                     JACOBY
                              (walking a fine line)
                         The night after Laura died I followed 
                         a man Laura had spoken to me about. 
                         He was driving a red corvette. I 
                         lost him near the Old Sawmill Road.  
                         That, gentlemen, is all I can tell 
                         you.

               Lucy interrupts on the intercom.

                         Agent Cooper, there is a Gordon Cole 
                         on the phone. He says you're expecting 
                         his call and that I should put him 
                         through to you, should I?

                                     COOPER
                         Put him through.
                              (to Jacoby)
                         That will be all.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You'll be in town, Doctor?

                                     JACOBY
                         I'm planning a pilgrimage to Pebble 
                         Beach, but that's not 'til the end 
                         of the month.
                              (wiggles his thumb 
                              and little finger)
                         Hang loose, Houlies.

               He's gone. Cooper sets up the speaker phone on the table in 
               front of a chair.

                                     COOPER
                         Does Leo Johnson drive a red corvette?

                         Yes.

                         There's an APB on him. His brother 
                         Bernie made bail this morning. I've 
                         put a tail on him.

                                     COOPER
                         This is my supervisor calling.

                              on the speaker)
                         Good morning, Gordon, how are we 
                         doing?

                         The Palmer girl or Albert's new best 
                         friend, Harry Truman.

                         Albert has been very busy despite 
                         the handsome shiner. The twine he 
                         found on her upper arms is a common 
                         household variety: Finley's Fine 
                         Twine.

                                     COOPER
                         And the twine on her wrists?

                                     COLE'S VOICE
                         Definitely not a match. No ID yet. 
                         And those marks on her shoulders? 
                         Bird bites. Albert thinks he'll have 
                         specifics this afternoon vis-a-vis 
                         genus and species.

                         He'll also be faxing a reconstruction 
                         of the plastic fragment from her 
                         stomach.

                                     COOPER
                         Tell Albert we're anxiously awaiting 
                         his results.

                                     COLE'S VOICE
                         Now for the bad news. Coop, I've got 
                         an O.O.J. and an A.F.O. here from 
                         Albert concerning his mano y mano 
                         with the local Sheriff Truman.

               Truman makes a gesture offering to leave. Cooper motions him 
               to stay.

                                     COLE
                         Albert wants this guy's badge.

               We can almost hear Harry's expletive as he goes to the window.

                                     COOPER
                         Gordon, here's how it is: you know 
                         Albert. In my opinion, Sheriff Truman 
                         displayed the patience of a saint in 
                         not clocking him a day earlier than 
                         he did--

                         He wants it filed with the U.S. 
                         Attorney--

                                     COOPER
                         File it under "f" for "forget it"--

                                     COOPER
                         And you tell Albert, if he wants to 
                         pursue this I'll fight him all the 
                         way up the chain to Washington. I'll 
                         talk to you later, Gordon.

               Cooper hangs up as Andy enters with his sketch.

                         I thanks, I didn't sleep too well 
                         last night.

                         Harry, the last thing you're gonna 
                         worry about while I'm here is some 
                         city slicker I brought into your 
                         town relieving himself upstream.
                              (takes the sketch 
                              from Andy)
                         This is the man I saw in my dream.

                         You saw this man?

                         I had an intuition that my dream and 
                         Sarah Palmer's vision were connected. 
                         I didn't go with you this morning so 
                         I wouldn't influence her. I'm a strong 
                         sender.

                         The eyes were a bit closer together.

                ED HURLEY'S GAS FARM - DAY

               Re-establish. PAN to the Hurley residence, across the street.

                                                                    

                ED HURLEY'S HOUSE - DAY

               ED and his assistant, SPARKY, a wizened eager beaver, enter 
               and tiptoe into the living room to examine Nadine's rowing 
               machine. The oars are bent like a "z."

                                     ED
                         Watch you don't track any grease, 
                         Sparky.
                              (they kneel down and 
                              look at the machine)
                         How the heck could Nadine bend the 
                         thing like that?

                                     SPARKY
                         That's tempered steel, Edsker.

               Ed glances at the window, picks up the phone.

                                     ED
                         Nadine's still rummaging around out 
                         in the garage. Catch an eye, will 
                         ya, Sparky.

                         Safe as houses, Edsker.

               Ed dials. After a couple of rings his call is answered.

                         Shelly... hi, it's Ed Hurley. I need 
                         to talk to Norma. It's kind of 
                         important.

                DOUBLE R DINER - DAY

               SHELLY JOHNSON has answered Ed's call. As she talks she 
               watches "Invitation to Love" on the tube, with the sounds 
               turned down

                                                                  :

               Chet searches through a pile of legal briefs beside a bed 
               where JARED sleeps soundly.

                         You just missed her, Ed. She's left 
                         for Hank's parole hearing.

                                     ED
                         Shoot. Shelly, when she gets back 
                         could you tell her...

               Sparky sees Nadine approaching. He gives Ed the high sign, 
               takes out a wrench and moves back to the rowing machine. 
               NADINE HURLEY enters carrying a breakfast tray.

                                     ED
                         ...you tell Mrs. Milford not to drive 
                         anywhere without an extra set of lug 
                         nuts.

               He hangs up the phone and turns to Nadine. She displays the 
               tray, loaded with food, a newspaper, a pot of coffee and a 
               grease gun. Nadine smiles seductively at Ed.

                                     NADINE
                         Eggs and bacon and sausage and ham 
                         and and whole wheat toast and juice 
                         and coffee. And the sports section, 
                         and a grease gun for working on my 
                         rower.

                                     ED
                              (confused)
                         What's the occasion, Nadine?

                                     NADINE
                              (whispers seductively 
                              in his ear)
                         I'm gonna get a good lawyer, Ed.

               She kisses him. He's alarmed. She whispers.

                                     NADINE
                         There's a damn good patent lawyer in 
                         Fairvale. Those drape runners are 
                         going to make us a fortune.

                                                                    

                STATE PRISON - DAY

               Establish.

                                                                    

                INSTITUTIONAL CORRIDOR - DAY

               NORMA JENNINGS sits pensively on a bench outside the door. 
               WILSON MOONEY, the parole officer, emerges from another door 
               to the cell block.

                                     MOONEY
                         I've arranged for you to have a little 
                         chat with Hank before the hearing. 
                         He's glad you're here.
                              (a tad nervous)
                         Hope I didn't come on too strong 
                         yesterday--

                                     NORMA
                         I'll be sure to tell him how helpful 
                         you've been, Mr. Mooney.

               Mooney moves off. The door to the cell block opens and HANK 
               JENNINGS is led out by a GUARD. Hank is forty, good looking 
               in a rough way. Alarmingly charming. He brightens as the 
               Guard leads him towards Norma who slowly stands as Hank 
               reaches her.

                                     HANK
                         Haven't seen you for awhile, Norma.

                                     NORMA
                         Been kind'a busy.

                                     HANK
                         So... business is good.

                                     NORMA
                         Yeah.

               Pause. Hank seems suddenly, terribly vulnerable.

                                     HANK
                         Back me up in there, Norma, please. 
                         I gotta get out. It's starting to 
                         put the zap on me, big time.

                                     NORMA
                              (pause, a whisper)
                         You think it's that easy?

                                     HANK
                         I know I've got no right to ask and 
                         you've got no reason to believe me, 
                         but... I'll change. I swear on my 
                         life. I have changed. Give me a chance 
                         to prove it to you.

               The Guard steps back in and moves him away. A hint of weakness 
               in Norma's eyes.

                                                                    

                PAROLE BOARD HEARING ROOM - DAY

               Hank sits at a long table with Mooney, across from two BOARD 
               MEMBERS, a middle-aged neatnik and a younger woman with a 
               granite bouffant hairdo. Three other BOARD MEMBERS are spread 
               around the table. Norma sits to one side and watches Hank.

                                     HANK
                         I've replayed it my mind a million 
                         times. I just don't have any answers. 
                         A car in perfect condition goes out 
                         of control. A vagrant nobody knows 
                         is killed sleeping on the roadside. 
                         Why? Why did fate deal me this hand?

                                     MALE BOARD MEMBER
                         You were not incarcerated for an act 
                         of fate, Mr. Jennings.

                                     HANK
                         I accept that. But it was fate, maybe 
                         in an odd way, even luck that sent 
                         me to prison. Just as much as that 
                         accident.

                                     WOMAN BOARD MEMBER
                         What is your point?

                                     HANK
                         That my time here has been good for 
                         me. You don't spend eighteen months 
                         in a nine-by-five box without facing 
                         your life. Without figuring what 
                         went wrong with your life before. 
                         Without planning to make it better. 
                         Without learning to get down on your 
                         hands and knees and pray for a second 
                         chance.
                              (pause)
                         I know I've got a lot to make up 
                         for. The life I destroyed... and 
                         another life I very nearly destroyed.

               Hank takes a long loving look at Norma. Board members study 
               her.

                                     WOMAN BOARD MEMBER
                         Mrs. Jennings, your husband would be 
                         facing a difficult re-entry. How 
                         would you help him?

                                     NORMA
                         I own the Double R Diner in Twin 
                         Peaks. I can give him a job. The 
                         boss is tough, but fair.

               This gets a slight chuckle from the board.

                                     WOMAN BOARD MEMBER
                         And you would live together as man 
                         and wife?

               Pause. Hank edges his seat forward, it makes a loud scraping 
               noise. Norma looks at Hank.

                                     NORMA
                         He's my husband, isn't he?

               Pause. Hank mouths a silent, "thank you."

                                     MALE BOARD MEMBER
                         We've got what we need here. We'll 
                         decide what recommendation to make 
                         without the inmate present.

                                     WOMAN BOARD MEMBER TWO
                         We'll let you know by five o'clock 
                         today.

               Hank idly rubs a key chain. Its handle is a WHITE DOMINO 
               with SIX BLACK DOTS.

               Hank is led out by the Guard. Norma watches him go.

                                     HANK
                              (smiles, says quietly)
                         Catch you later.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                       

                                         ACT TWO

               FADE IN:

                TWIN PEAKS HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

               Re-establish. A bell rings.

                                                                    

                TWIN PEAKS HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS' ROOM - DAY

               Donna Hayward stands in front of the mirror, looking at 
               herself, brushing her hair. AUDREY HORNE enters and 
               immediately lights a cigarette.

                                     AUDREY
                         I've been doing some research. In 
                         real life there is no algebra.

                                     DONNA
                         Maybe you should run away and join 
                         the circus.

                                     AUDREY
                         Escape! I've got a better idea. A 
                         tall, dark and handsome stranger 
                         falls madly in love with me and takes 
                         me away to a life of mystery and 
                         international intrigue.

                                     DONNA
                         You mean that FBI Agent? Dream on.

                                     AUDREY
                         Maybe. Or maybe he'll realize I'm 
                         the woman of his dreams because I'm 
                         going to help him figure out who 
                         killed Laura.

                                     DONNA
                         Is that so?

                                     AUDREY
                         Yes. And you're going to help me. 
                         Fact: Laura was seeing James Hurley 
                         behind Bobby's back.

                                     DONNA
                              (defensive)
                         What if she was?

                                     AUDREY
                              (off her reaction)
                         So it is true. Fact: Laura had a 
                         sweet tooth for nose candy.

                                     DONNA
                         I guess that's not such a big secret.

                                     AUDREY
                         Please. I didn't know Laura half as 
                         well as you and I knew the score; 
                         Laura was wild. Will you help me?

                                     DONNA
                              (getting into it)
                         What else have you figured out, 
                         Sherlock?

                                     AUDREY
                         The morning of the funeral, Dr. 
                         Jacoby's talking to my, brother 
                         Johnny, trying to get him to go to 
                         the funeral...
                              (offers a cigarette 
                              to Donna who declines)
                         So he tells Johnny that Laura was in 
                         a better place now, blah, blah, blah 
                         and he knows that... because... Laura 
                         was his patient.

                                     DONNA
                              (new information)
                         Laura was seeing Jacoby?

                                     AUDREY
                         Mucho de-weirdo, huh? It gets better. 
                         Ever heard of "One-Eyed Jacks?"

                                     DONNA
                         Isn't that a Western with Marlon 
                         Brando?

                                     AUDREY
                         No. It's a place up north across the 
                         border. They have "girls" working 
                         there.

               Audrey takes a long drag on her cigarette for effect. Donna's 
               intrigued

                                     DONNA
                         Are you saying you think Laura was 
                         one of them?

                                     AUDREY
                         I don't know. But if it's true, 
                         wouldn't you want to know about it?

                                     DONNA
                         It sure would explain a few things.

                                     AUDREY
                         You know, I think about it, I think 
                         about Laura being in a place like 
                         that and I get all shivery, but it's 
                         like a hot cold, like when you hold 
                         an ice cube on your bare skin for a 
                         long time.

                                     DONNA
                         Audrey, I'll help you but whatever 
                         we find out, we have to promise to 
                         keep this between ourselves. Our 
                         secret.

                                     AUDREY
                         It's a deal. And I know exactly where 
                         to start, did you know Ronette and 
                         Laura worked at the same place.

               Donna didn't. The school bell rings for class. Audrey douses 
               her cigarette in the sink.

               Audrey goes out.

                                                                    

                TIMER FALLS MOTEL - DAY

               A car door. The door opens and a hand pours the remains of a 
               cup of coffee out of an expensive piece of china. The coffee 
               drips onto the dirt of the parking lot. CAMERA MOVES UP to 
               reveal JOSIE PACKARD behind the wheel. She focuses a camera 
               with a telescopic lens.

               CAMERA MOVES BACK to show Josie in her Jaguar outside the 
               motel, parked next to a construction dumpster in the dirt 
               parking lot.

               CLOSE on a television tuned to "INVITATION TO LOVE." FADE UP 
               on a legal document that reads: "Last Will and Testament."

               The document is rolled up and inserted in Emerald's purse. 
               She moves to Chet, who sits, demoralized, destroyed. Emerald 
               gives him a motherly kiss on the forehead.

               Doorbell. Chet drags himself to the door. Opens it to discover 
               Jade holding flowers.

                         I think it's time we all had a nice 
                         talk.

               As this plays out there is LOUD ORGASMIC GROANING off camera.

                                     BEN HORNE'S VOICE
                         Oh... yes... yes... there... yes...

               CAMERA MOVES BACK to reveal CATHERINE MARTELL on the bed 
               giving BEN HORNE a post-coital back rub.

                                     CATHERINE
                         --I wish I could have seen Josie's 
                         face, opening the safe to show her 
                         lawman Romeo the double set of 
                         books... and all she finds is the 
                         one I've been slowly cooking.

                         I have more than one hiding place. 
                         My desk, upstairs. A drop panel in 
                         the top drawer. Not even Pete the 
                         poodle knows about that one.

               Catherine takes a sip of wine, turns off the TV set with a 
               remote.

                                     CATHERINE
                         I'm famished. I suppose room service 
                         is too much to ask of this rusticated 
                         mildew farm.

                         I'd prefer that we get on with setting 
                         the torch to that damn mill. Because

                         the mill goes up in smoke, the 
                         headline we're after is "Josie Packard

                         That's fine and dandy. Just bear in 
                         mind, "darling," that if this 
                         opportunity is wasted, or you in

                         Perish the thought.

                                                                    

                MOTEL - DAY

               Truman's cruiser pulls up by the dumpster. Josie's car is 
               gone. Cooper, Truman, and Andy get out of cruiser. Hawk walks 
               up to meet them.

                                     HAWK
                         Room 301. Last name is Gerard.

               The foursome moves cautiously towards a room. Truman takes 
               the lead, motions Hawk to go around to the side. Hawk moves 
               off. They reach the door. Truman knocks.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Open up, please, it's the police.

                                                                    

                MOTEL ROOM B - DAY

               Still no answer from inside. Truman slowly takes out his 
               pistol. Cooper draws his, Andy nervously takes out his gun; 
               he drops it and it DISCHARGES. Cooper glares at Andy. Truman 
               picks up the gun and waves Andy to the back.

                                                                    

                MOTEL ROOM B - DAY

               The door is opened by a genial, mild mannered ONE-ARMED MAN, 
               ringing wet from a shower, a towel wrapped around his waist.

                                     GERARD
                         Sorry, I was in the shower...
                              (sees the weapons)

                                     TRUMAN
                              (not taking any chances)
                         Sir, please move back into the room... 
                         slowly.

                                                                    

                MOTEL ROOM

               Ben picks up his clothes.

                                     BEN
                         I'm going to give Little Elvis a 
                         bath.

               He goes into the bathroom. Catherine laughs, then notices 
               something has dropped out of Ben's pants. Catherine crosses 
               and picks it up.

                                                                  :

               INSERT

               A THOUSAND DOLLAR POKER CHIP from One-Eyed Jack's.

               Catherine slow-burns with anger.

                                                               

                MOTEL ROOM B - DAY

               The one armed Man, now in a bathrobe, sits on the bed studying 
               Andy's sketch. Hawk is on the phone holding a wallet.

                                     HAWK
                         Wants and warrants on a Phillip 
                         Michael Gerard.

               The man hands the sketch back to Truman.

                                     GERARD
                         No sir, never seen that man before. 
                         Sorry. But you know what? 'Kind of 
                         looks like somebody doesn't he?

               Truman walks over to two suitcases that sit by the bed.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Do you mind if we look in these?

                                     GERARD
                         Help yourself.

               With a nod from the sheriff Andy moves to the suitcases

                                     COOPER
                         Mr. Gerard, do you have a friend 
                         named Bob?

                                     GERARD
                         Bob... oh, you mean Bob Lydecker. 
                         Sure, Bob's my best friend. I'm on 
                         my western swing, I heard about it, 
                         I'm in town visiting him in the 
                         hospital. Bob's in a coma.

                                     TRUMAN
                         There was a Lydecker assaulted three 
                         days ago outside a bar in Lowtown.

                                     GERARD
                         That's Bob.

                                     COOPER
                         Any suspects?

                                     TRUMAN
                         No.

                                     COOPER
                         Is your friend Bob a doctor?

                                     GERARD
                         He's a veterinarian. Just about the 
                         best darn veterinarian in these parts. 
                         Extremely dedicated. Has his own 
                         clinic about eight years now. No 
                         maybe seven. Let's see...'81... I'm 
                         still at computer school... yeah, 
                         it's eight years.

                                     COOPER
                         In my dream he was a regular doctor.

                                     GERARD
                         What's that, mister?

               Hawk hangs up the phone, hands Gerard's wallet to Truman.

                                     HAWK
                         He's clean.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Take a look at his car.

               Hawk takes the keys and goes out. Cooper looks at Gerard's 
               ID.

                                     COOPER
                         Your middle name is "Michael?"

                                     GERARD
                         Named after my uncle. Uncle Mike.

                                     COOPER
                         How did you lose your arm?

                                     GERARD
                         Car accident. I was on the road from 
                         Memphis to someplace, selling 
                         pharmaceuticals. Pretty good job, 
                         Smokey Mountains Sales Rep. I had 
                         benefits.

               In background Andy's checking Gerard's suitcases. One of 
               them practically explodes open. A pile of WORKBOOTS and 
               INSTITUTIONAL SHOES fall out.

                                     GERARD
                         That's what I'm selling these days. 
                         Everybody needs shoes, don't they?

                                     ANDY
                         They're all for the right foot.

                                     GERARD
                         Those are just samples, son. We mail 
                         order all our sales, two-day delivery 
                         guaranteed. And we could certainly 
                         take care of your departmental needs, 
                         if your interested.

               Cooper, with Gerard's wallet still in his hand, reaches behind 
               Gerard's drivers license, takes out one of Gerard's cards, 
               and hands it to Truman.

                         The arm you lost, did it have a 
                         tattoo?

                                     GERARD
                              (strangely distressed)
                         What is this all about? I'm a shoe 
                         salesman--

                                     TRUMAN
                         Settle down, he just asked you a 
                         question--

                                     COOPER
                         If you won't tell us, we can find 
                         out. What did it say?

                                     GERARD
                         It said "MOM."

                                                                    

                MOTEL - DAY

               As Cooper and Andy get into Truman's cruiser, Hawk discretely 
               motions Truman over to the dumpster. Hawk kneels down, dips 
               his finger in the spilled coffee, speaks quietly.

                                     HAWK
                         Car was staked out when I got here. 
                         It was Josie Packard.
                              (they exchange a look. 
                              Truman's puzzled)
                         And not that it means anything, but 
                         Ben Horne's car was parked two blocks 
                         away.

                                                                    

                LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY

               Re-establish.

                                                                    

                LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY

               We discover Shelly Johnson and BOBBY BRIGGS in a steamy kiss.

                                     SHELLY
                         I feel so bad for you.

               Bobby gives her a confused look.

                                     SHELLY
                         I was watching you at the funeral. 
                         My heart was aching, I wanted to 
                         hold you so much.

                                     BOBBY
                         That James Hurley. He was seeing 
                         Laura behind my back. I'm gonna fix 
                         him.

               Another kiss.

                                     SHELLY
                         Fix me first.

               Shelly begins to unbutton Bobby's shirt.

                                     BOBBY
                         Where's Leo?

                                     SHELLY
                         Don't worry, bad boy, I can hear his 
                         'Vette a mile away.

                                     BOBBY
                         Don't mess around about this, Shelly, 
                         where is he?

                                     SHELLY
                         He took off with his friend, that 
                         creepy Jacques.

                                     BOBBY
                         Jacques who?

                                     SHELLY
                         Jacques that Canuck guy who works at 
                         the Roadhouse.

               Bobby breaks away from Shelly.

                                     BOBBY
                         Leo and Jacques.

                                     SHELLY
                         What's the matter?

                                     BOBBY
                         I gotta think. I gotta think.

                                     SHELLY
                              (still on sex)
                         Think later. I got to be back at the 
                         diner in a half hour.

               Bobby makes a decision. Lie.

                                     BOBBY
                         Shelly, I gotta tell you something.

                                     SHELLY
                         What?

                                     BOBBY
                         I've been on to this for a while, 
                         I've been checking it out. It's pretty 
                         bad.

                                     SHELLY
                         Tell me.

                                     BOBBY
                         Leo and Jacques are running drugs 
                         across the border. Cocaine. And 
                         they're selling 'em to kids at school.

                                     SHELLY
                         Oh my God, I knew it, I knew Leo was 
                         messed up in something.

                                     BOBBY
                         I know it's shocking. I think it's 
                         even possible that they were giving 
                         drugs to Laura.

                                     SHELLY
                              (goes pale)
                         Bobby? Bobby, I got to show you 
                         something. Oh my God.

               She goes to her secret hiding place behind the cabinet and 
               takes out Leo's bloody shirt.

                                     SHELLY
                         This was in Leo's truck, two days 
                         after Laura was murdered.

                                     BOBBY
                         You sure this is Leo's?

                                     SHELLY
                         It's got his initials sewn in the 
                         collar, see? He makes me sew labels 
                         into everything--

                                     BOBBY
                         Shelly, this... this could be the 
                         answer to our prayers.

                                     SHELLY
                         What do you mean?

                                     BOBBY
                              (takes the shirt)
                         You don't need to know. I'm gonna 
                         take this. You never saw it. Say it, 
                         "you never saw this--"

                                     SHELLY
                         I never saw it.

                                     BOBBY
                              (mind racing)
                         Leo is not going to be a problem for 
                         us anymore. You stay clear of him 
                         and don't say anything--

               She lifts her gun out of the hiding place.

                                     SHELLY
                         I bought this.

                                     BOBBY
                         You know how to use it?

                                     SHELLY
                         I thought you might be able to teach 
                         me.
                              (getting hot)
                         Teach me, Bobby. Will you?

               Lust.

                                                                    

                THE TWIN PEAKS ECONO SHOPPER - DAY

               On Cooper looking ABOVE THE CAMERA.

                                     COOPER
                         In my dream. Mike said he and Bob 
                         lived above a convenience store.

               Cooper is standing in front of a convenience store, the TWIN 
               PEAKS ECONO SHOPPER. Two stories high. Truman stands next to 
               Cooper.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'd think you'd be afraid to go to 
                         sleep at night.

               Behind them Andy and Hawk get out of Hawk's patrol car.

                                     COOPER
                         Andy, would you please go into the 
                         Econo Shopper and buy some twine?

                                     ANDY
                         Okay.

               CAMERA MOVES UP to a shop above the convenience store. A 
               sign reads: "Lydecker Veterinarian Clinic - Aid to the Beast 
               Incarnate"

                                                                    

                THE LYDEKER CLINIC - DAY

               Cooper and Truman stand at a counter. Behind the counter 
               Lydecker's assistant MIDGE LOOMER looks at the sketch then 
               hands it back to Truman.

                                     LOOMER
                         Nope. That's not Dr. Lydecker.

                                     COOPER
                         Does Dr. Lydeker treat birds?

                                     LOOMER
                         Oh, yes.

                                     TRUMAN
                         There's a lot of vets in Twin Peaks.

                                     COOPER
                         Only one has a best friend with one 
                         arm. Harry, in the heat of 
                         investigative pursuit, the shortest 
                         distance between two points is not 
                         necessarily a straight line.

               Andy enters with a brown bag.

                                     COOPER
                         Andy hand me that spool of Finley's 
                         Fine Twine.

               Amazed, Andy reaches into the bag and takes out... a spool 
               of Finley's Fine Twine.

                                     COOPER
                         Ms. Loomer we're going to have to 
                         confiscate your files.
                              (to Cooper)
                         As clear as the signs on the turnpike. 
                         The bird that attacked Laura Palmer 
                         is a client of this office.

                BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY

               Ben Home is on the telephone, looking at a globe.

                                     BEN
                         --Jerry, Jer, slow down, I know you're 
                         in Iceland but where are you in 
                         Iceland?... how do you spell that? 
                         Two 'k's', one 'f', one 'v'...
                              (locates it on the 
                              globe)
                         Yeah, I see it, Jerry, are you 
                         drunk?... what's all that noise?... 
                         you're in the sauna now or... I see... 
                         no, I don't need to talk to anyone 
                         else...
                              (Jerry has handed the 
                              phone to an Icelander)

                         too, sir... okay, put my brother 
                         back on would you?... a joke? sure, 
                         go ahead...
                              (the Icelander tells 
                              Ben a joke)

                         quarter'll buy me a piece of ice on 
                         a stick... you're flying in when? 
                         Tonight? That's outstanding... how 
                         many? Fifteen? Do they all need 
                         separate rooms?...

               The intercom buzzes and we hear a SECRETARY'S VOICE.

                                     SECRETARY'S VOICE
                         Mr. Horne, we've got a situation in 
                         the dining room.

               Ben can hear distant strains of "In the Mood" from another 
               part of the hotel. Ben's alarmed.

                                     BEN
                         Jerry? Jerry, I've got to go, get 
                         those high-rolling snowballs on the 
                         plane, I'll see you here in the 
                         morning.

               He hangs up and heads directly for the door.

                                                                    

                GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - DAY

               In the bar area, Leland Palmer is dancing what looks to be a 
               cross between the Lindy and the Tennessee Waltz with his 
               SECRETARY, a middle-aged gal in a suit. The Secretary looks 
               to Ben, hoping for something just short of gunplay to rescue 
               her. On the other hand, she's a hell of a dancer. Overall, 
               they look good.

                                     LELAND
                         Dance with me! Dance with me!

                                     BEN
                         Leland. Leland.

               Leland goes into a dance solo towards Ben. Hands him a framed 
               picture. Ben looks at it: a snapshot photo of Laura and 
               Audrey.

                                     LELAND
                         This was on your desk! Our daughters, 
                         together!

               Ben pushes his way in between Leland and the secretary.

                                     BEN
                         Mind if I cut in?

               Once in, Ben moves the Secretary away from Leland. Ben lets 
               her out of the room, goes back to Leland and grabs him firmly 
               by the shoulders.

                                     BEN
                         Leland. Leland. You gave me that 
                         picture, remember?
                              (Leland comes to a 
                              stop)
                         Calm down. Stop it.

                                     LELAND
                         She loved dancing. She loved to 
                         dance... she'd stand on my shoes... 
                         I taught her... come and dance with 
                         me... she was a good little dancer...

               He cries. Ben takes him into an embrace. Pats him on the 
               back.

                                                                    

                SHERIFF'S STATION RECEPTION AREA - DAY

               Cooper, Truman, Andy and Hawk enter carrying files from the 
               veterinarian's, past Lucy at reception. Truman rests his for 
               a moment on Lucy's counter.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Fellas, take 'em right into the 
                         conference room. Lucy, I need you to 
                         go through these files and pull out 
                         all the people who own birds.

                                     LUCY
                         How will I know they own birds?

                                     TRUMAN
                         It will say so on the cards.

                                     LUCY
                         Okay, I'll start going through the 
                         files, then.

                                                                    

                INTERROGATION A - DAY

               Hawk sets his box down and exits. Cooper is about to exit 
               when Andy takes him aside.

                                     ANDY
                         Agent Cooper? I'm so sorry, I don't 
                         know what happened, the gun just 
                         slipped out of my hand.

                                     COOPER
                         Have you ever used your weapon in 
                         the line of duty?

                                     ANDY
                         No, sir, I haven't. I can't explain 
                         what happened, I've been feeling a 
                         little high-strung--

                                     COOPER
                         It was a lack of preparation. We'll 
                         take care of that.

               TRUMAN ENTERS TO SAY:

                                     TRUMAN
                         Andy, get some ammunition from the 
                         lockbox and meet us downstairs at 
                         the pistol range.

               Cooper and Truman exit.

                                                                    

                SHERIFF'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY

               Andy goes into Lucy's office to retrieve a key. Lucy won't 
               look at him, slides her chair out of the way, lets him take 
               the key. Andy's aching.

                                     ANDY
                         Lucy, did you hear what happened? I 
                         feel so dumb. I dropped my gun and 
                         it went off.

                                     LUCY
                              (a hint of concern)
                         Are you okay?

                                     ANDY
                         Oh, yeah, I guess so, but I...

                                     LUCY
                              (remembering the war 
                              of the sexes)
                         I would like to chat, but I am now 
                         under orders to examine these files, 
                         so if you'll excuse me please?

               She exits. Andy's completely perplexed.

                                                                    

                FIRING RANGE - DAY

               Cooper, Truman, and Hawk set up at the basement shooting 
               range. There are two targets at the end of corridors for 
               them to shoot at.

                                     COOPER
                         Laura Palmer's murder was vicious 
                         and calculated. There's no telling 
                         what we'll encounter bringing a 
                         suspect to ground. After Andy's 
                         accident at the motel I want to be 
                         absolutely certain we're all 
                         comfortable and confident with our 
                         firearms.

               Cooper takes out his gun. The other two admire it.

                                     HAWK
                         Nice piece.

                                     COOPER
                         Actually it's regular issue, but 
                         I've made some modifications.
                              (to Truman)
                         How long has Lucy been upset with 
                         Andy?

                                     TRUMAN
                              (thinks he knows how)
                         Body language?

                                     COOPER
                         In this case, it was yelling through 
                         a megaphone.

               Before Truman can talk about him, Andy arrives with the ammo.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Six rounds apiece to start with, 
                         Andy.

                                     ANDY
                              (still with and on 
                              Lucy)
                         Okay.

               Andy glumly distributes bullets to the others, who load up. 
               Cooper slickly arms his own gun with a clip from his pocket.

                                     COOPER
                         Care to tell us about you and Lucy, 
                         Andy?

                                     ANDY
                         Geez, you can tell?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Not too many secrets left around 
                         here.

                                     ANDY
                         She won't speak to me and I don't 
                         know what I did and I don't know why 
                         she's doing what she's doing.

                                     COOPER
                              (chairing the 
                              discussion)
                         Andy, there are a number of old saying 
                         which might pertain to this 
                         discussion. Suffice it to say you're 
                         up against the oldest unsolvable 
                         mystery known to man.

                                     ANDY
                         And I feel like I don't know one 
                         doggone thing.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It's weird. The mystery's what I 
                         like the most... and the less I know 
                         the more interested I get.

               A look between Cooper and Truman. Josie.

                                     ANDY
                         But I just can't figure her out.

                                     COOPER
                         There's no logic at work here, Andy. 
                         Let that one go. In the grand design, 
                         women were drawn from a different 
                         set of blueprints.

                                     HAWK
                         Amen to that.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hawk, Andy.

                                     COOPER
                         Rapid fire.

               All four men put on headphone ear protectors. Hawk and Andy 
               fire six rapid shots down their separate corridors. Truman 
               hits a button, the targets to return. They take off their 
               protectors.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (to Cooper, back to 
                              women)
                         So where do you stand on the mystery 
                         of it all?

               Cooper inspects Hawk and Andy's targets.

                                     COOPER
                         Harry, the way I look at it a 
                         mystery's just a solution waiting 
                         for the right set of facts. Here, 
                         we're dealing with an area that's 
                         closer to a paradox or an enigma...
                              (examining the targets)
                         Hawk, six of six, two kills, high 
                         marks... Andy...
                              (being delicate)
                         What you need is practice and plenty 
                         of it. One hour, three times a week. 
                         Harry, you'll supply the ordinance?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Whatever it takes.

                                     COOPER
                         Chin up, Andy.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (as he and Cooper 
                              prepare to shoot)
                         Ever been married, Cooper?

                                     COOPER
                         No. I knew someone once who helped 
                         me understand commitment, it's 
                         responsibilities and it's risks

               The four put their ear protectors back on.

                                     COOPER
                              (alone)
                         ...who taught me about the pain of a 
                         broken heart.

               Cooper and Truman fire six shots. Truman hits the button to 
               return the targets.

                         One woman can make you fly like the 
                         eagle, another can give you the 
                         strength of a lion. But only one in 
                         the cycle of life will fill your 
                         heart with wonder and the wisdom 
                         that you have known a singular joy.

               This stops the group.

                                     HAWK
                         I wrote that about my girlfriend.

                                     COOPER
                         Local gal?

                                     HAWK
                         Darlene Shapiro, PHD Brandeis. Legal 
                         counsel for the Bureau of Indian 
                         Affairs.

               Cooper whistles in appreciation, then looks at Truman's 
               target, as Cooper looks at his.

                                     COOPER
                         Harry, one miss, five hits, three 
                         kills. Excellent.

               Truman holds Cooper's. Disappointed.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I don't see a hit here.

                                     COOPER
                         I put four shots through the eyes 
                         and one through each nostril.

               Hawk takes the target out of Truman's hands. Holds it up to 
               the light. Cooper has used his six shots to pierce the 
               nostrils and the eyes. Light comes through from behind. The 
               threesome stares in awe. We hear a beep, then Lucy's voice 
               on the intercom.

                                     LUCY'S VOICE
                         Agent Cooper, I am looking at the 
                         files from Dr. Lydecker's? And for 
                         instance I have here in the "A's" an 
                         Arky, who's a part poodle-part 
                         rotweiler, who lives on Maple and 
                         belongs to Mr. Rumple, then for 
                         example I have an Annette, who is a 
                         otter who lives with a family near 
                         Elk River

                                     COOPER
                         We wanted the names of birds

                                     LUCY
                         I know, but the files are all 
                         organized alphabetically

                                     TRUMAN
                         So go through the bird section--

                                     LUCY
                         No, no, you don't understand; they're 
                         organized alphabetically in the name 
                         of the pet.

               Cooper and Truman look at each other.

                                     COOPER
                         We're gonna need some more coffee.

                                                                    

                JAMES HURLEY'S HOME - DAY

               A housetrailer in the middle of a lonely lot with a couple 
               of aluminum lean-to's off the house. The shades on the windows 
               are drawn. James is working on his Harley under a lean-to.

               James looks up as a car drives down the driveway to the house. 
               COLLEEN HURLEY exits the car, laughing, carrying a small 
               suitcase. She's forty, gave James his good looks. Her's are 
               on the way out. She waves goodbye to the unidentified MIDDLE-
               AGED GENT behind the wheel and the car drives off.

               Colleen sees James, waves, moves towards him.

                                     COLLEEN
                         There he is, the fair-haired boy, 
                         where have you been, my fair-haired 
                         boy?

                                     JAMES
                         I was at school. It's a school day.

                                     COLLEEN
                              (takes out a flask)
                         God bless the public indoctrination 
                         system. Keeps the kids off the 
                         streets... streets are for street-
                         cars and street-sweepers...
                              (takes a drink)

                                     JAMES
                         Where'd you go this time?

                                     COLLEEN
                         Taught a kid in prison once, this 
                         was Ohio, all he wanted out of life 
                         was a job as a San Francisco street 
                         sweeper

                                     JAMES
                         Ma, you been gone four days.

                                     COLLEEN
                         Kiddo, here's how it is; when the 
                         muse cries out, we're helpless to 
                         resist. A poem, she said, four days 
                         worth. Yes, I replied.

                                     JAMES
                              (trying to hide his 
                              feelings)
                         Are you okay?

                                     COLLEEN
                         Myself, I've been better. The poem's 
                         pretty good.

               Takes out a legal pad from the messy suitcase.

                                     COLLEEN
                         I learned early on, write it down, 
                         escape the humdrum hand that life 
                         has dealt you. Play with marked cards.
                              (puts on glasses, 
                              reads)
                         "Poet lariat/Rope, Rope/Bulldogged 
                         down, Rodeo Town/The last of the

                                     JAMES
                         I don't want to hear this right now--

                                     COLLEEN
                         "--Sun goes down, rodeo town/Lariat

                                     JAMES
                         Stop!

               She takes off her glasses, looks at him.

                                     COLLEEN
                         Jimmy, are we being rude?

               James picks up the flask, pours the remainder in the dirt.

                                     COLLEEN
                         Okay, sonny boy, if it makes you 
                         feel better --

                                     JAMES
                              (turns on her)
                         You don't know... anything!

                                     COLLEEN
                         I know girl trouble when I see it. 
                         Some little logtown siren's cut you 
                         up. I recognize the wound patterns.

                                     JAMES
                              (almost laughs)
                         Yeah, you sure can spot it, Ma.

                                     COLLEEN
                         Am I right?

               An awful, bitter pause.

                                     JAMES
                         Her name was Laura.

                                     COLLEEN
                         Lash yourself to the mast, Odysseus.
                              (lifts her drink)
                         Eat the lotus. Forget her. Sail on.
                              (she strokes his face, 
                              compassionate)
                         The danger for you, my darling boy, 
                         is you'll never know whether she's 
                         an angel or a harpie sent from hell 
                         to rend your heart, because believe 
                         me, she'll be one or the other.

               James is close to tears. He can't combat this.

                                     JAMES
                         She was both.

                                     COLLEEN
                         Ah, but that's the secret, Jimmy 
                         boy. They all are.

               James is sickened. He lurches out the door.

                                                                    

                DOUBLE R DINER - DAY

               Re-establish.

                                                                    

                DOUBLE R DINER - DAY

               The slow hour at the end of the afternoon. Norma cleans up 
               the counter after a customer, a YOUNG TRUCKER who is just 
               leaving. Norma looks at his tip.

                                     NORMA
                         Thanks, Toad, I'll get this into my 
                         retirement fund A.S.A.P.

               Shelly hurries in. She storms by Norma, grabs her apron and 
               heads to the kitchen. Norma follows her, catching up with 
               her at the coffee maker. Good-naturedly.

                                     NORMA
                         Shelly, you're gonna scare the 
                         customers.

                                     SHELLY
                         I've got one man too many in my life. 
                         And I'm married to him. Sound 
                         familiar?

                                     NORMA
                         You think it's time you and Leo have 
                         a talk?

                                     SHELLY
                         Leo doesn't talk. He hits. He was so 
                         great at first, you know? This flashy 
                         guy in his hot car; sure beat sitting 
                         in some stupid classroom... we get 
                         married and I find out what he's 
                         lookin' for is a maid he doesn't 
                         have to pay... I feel so stupid.

               Norma gives her a hug.

                                     NORMA
                         Look at us. Two men apiece and we 
                         don't know what to do with any of 
                         the four of 'em.

                                     SHELLY
                              (feeling comforted)
                         How did Hank's hearing go?

                                     NORMA
                         They said they'd decide this 
                         afternoon.

                                     SHELLY
                         Have you told him you're going to 
                         divorce him for Ed?

                                     NORMA
                         When I saw him I... anyway, he might 
                         not get out this time around. Guess 
                         my plans are a little... up in the 
                         air.

                                     SHELLY
                              (cryptically)
                         Yeah, well, I definitely got plans 
                         for Leo.

               Norma tries to penetrate her look. James enters the diner 
               and goes right to the pay phones.

                                     NORMA
                         Shelly, you know what we're going to 
                         do tomorrow? You and I are going to 
                         have a Day of Beauty. Manicure, 
                         haircut, facial, the works. We are 
                         going to be the knockouts of the 
                         Double R--And it's my treat.

                                     SHELLY
                              (touched)
                         Yeah?

                                                                    

               JAMES

               On the pay phone.

                                     JAMES
                         Donna?

                                                                  :

                HAYWARD'S DINING ROOM - DAY

               Donna, in high spirits, is on the phone with James.

                                     DONNA
                         Hi, James.

               Behind Donna, Doc Hayward comes out of the kitchen holding a 
               recipe, wearing an apron that reads, "Genius at Work." Donna 
               laughs when she sees him...

                                     HAYWARD
                         Donna, who the heck ever heard of 
                         diet lasagne?

                                     DONNA
                         Just a sec--Daddy, please, I'll be 
                         right in, it's James--we're having 
                         the church pot luck dinner here 
                         tonight.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Tell him to get over here, I need 
                         help. SOS, Mayday, Mayday.

               He goes back in the kitchen. She speaks more confidentially.

                                     DONNA
                         Would you like to come?

                                     JAMES
                         I don't think I'd be very good 
                         company.

                                     DONNA
                         James, we need to talk. I've found 
                         some stuff out; Audrey told me some 
                         stuff and Mrs. Palmer saw something--

                                     JAMES
                         What?

               James sees Madeleine Ferguson waiting at the counter talking 
               to Norma.

                                     DONNA
                         Come over later so I can tell you. 
                         Will you come?

                                     JAMES
                         Okay. I'm gonna get something to eat 
                         then I'll be over.

               STAY WITH James. He hangs up. He looks up and sees...

                                                                  :

               JAMES POV - NORMA AND MADELEINE

                                     NORMA
                         I think it's ready, let me go check.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Thanks a lot.

               Practically trembling, James goes up to her. Madeleine looks 
               up, gives him a friendly smile.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Hi.

                                     JAMES
                         Who are you?

                                     MADELEINE
                         I saw you yesterday at the funeral. 
                         My name's Madeleine Ferguson. Laura 
                         was my cousin.

                                     JAMES
                              (still not really 
                              with her)
                         James Hurley.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Laura was a month older than me. 
                         Hadn't seen each other much recently. 
                         I live in Missoula. I'm a receptionist 
                         at a insurance company?
                              (instinctively trying 
                              to cheer him up)
                         Ever been to Missoula?

                                     JAMES
                         I heard it was nice.

                                     MADELEINE
                         From who?
                              (James smiles)
                         So you can smile. Missoula's not so 
                         bad actually.
                              (tries another subject)
                         Did you know Laura well?

                                     JAMES
                         I thought I did.

               Shelly sets Madeleine's order on the counter.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Thanks a lot.
                              (to James)
                         I'm picking up food for my aunt and 
                         uncle. Aunt Sarah can't cook right 
                         now and Uncle Leland's up half the 
                         night listening to old music and 
                         crying and stuff. But if I was cooking 
                         for them they'd be doing even worse. 
                         You think I look like Laura?

                                     JAMES
                         Yes.

                                     MADELEINE
                         We used to come visit Twin Peaks 
                         when I was a kid. It was great. We'd 
                         pretend we were sisters. I wished 
                         I'd known her better. It's so sad.

               James stares at Madeline. She smiles back, uncomplicated.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Well it was nice to meet you, James 
                         Hurley.

               James involuntarily begins to reach across death's void for 
               Laura. Then catches himself.

                                     JAMES
                         Nice to meet you too.

                                                                    

               NORMA

               On the house phone near the kitchen.

                                     NORMA
                         Thanks for calling, Mr. Mooney.

               She hangs up, pale, slowly runs her hands thru her hair. 
               Shelly sees her, stops.

                                     SHELLY
                         Norma? You okay?

                                     NORMA
                         Hank got his parole. He's coming 
                         home.

               They look at each other.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Ben is on the phone again with the Icelandics and Jerry, 
               riding an exercise machine.

                                     BEN
                         What's that? No, I'm afraid I don't 
                         know what you get when you cross a 
                         Norwegian and a Swede...
                              (a stiff laugh)
                         That's very good could you put Jerry 
                         back on again?
                              (pause)
                         Jer, who the hell is that joker?... 
                         damn airplane phones, I can hardly 
                         hear you--you're sure he's the 
                         boss?... just make sure they don't 
                         take any eggnog into the pilot... 
                         the jet's gassed up and waiting on 
                         the runway in Seattle, hustle 'em 
                         through customs, make the connection 
                         and save me some of whatever it is 
                         they're having...

               Ben hangs up, spins the globe around. He looks up to discover 
               Audrey standing in his office.

                                     BEN
                         Audrey... I didn't hear you come in.

               Audrey plops down sadly in a chair. Ben sits on the desk, 
               immediately suspicious.

                                     BEN
                         What is it this time?

                                     AUDREY
                         Dad, are you ashamed of me?

                                     BEN
                         Audrey, you're a...
                              (thinks better of 
                              total honestly)
                         You're my daughter.

                                     AUDREY
                         I've been thinking about what we 
                         talked about the other night when 
                         you were so mad.

                                     BEN
                         It's not that I'm ashamed, Audrey, 
                         it's just that I wish I could depend 
                         on you more, especially during a 
                         trying time like this.

                                     AUDREY
                         That's what I want to talk to you 
                         about. Dad, I want to change my life. 
                         I've decided I want to help you with 
                         the family business.
                              (she has his attention)
                         I mean, one of these days you're 
                         going to need someone to take over.  
                         Obviously, it's not going to be 
                         Johnnie.

                                     BEN
                         Audrey, I wish I could believe...

                                     AUDREY
                              (starts to cry)
                         Daddy, please, I saw a friend that 
                         I've known since childhood cut down 
                         like a flower that had just begun to 
                         bloom. Life can be so short. There 
                         isn't all the time in the world, I 
                         see that now. I want... to change... 
                         my life.

                              skeptical)
                         How, exactly?

                                     AUDREY
                         I don't need to go to college. You 
                         can teach me the business, I'm willing 
                         to start at the absolute bottom.

                                     BEN
                         Well, we've got some guests arriving. 
                         You could go upstairs and make some 
                         beds.

                                     AUDREY
                              (tears again)
                         You still don't believe me--

                                     BEN
                         Alright, alright, alright. Where 
                         would you start?

                                     AUDREY
                         I think I should start at the 
                         Department Store; cosmetics or 
                         something. Part-time, at first, 'til 
                         I graduate.

               Ben comes over to her. Beginning to accept this peace 
               offering.

                                     BEN
                         You're really serious about this.

                                     AUDREY
                         You have to start thinking about the 
                         future, Daddy, just like I am.

                                     BEN
                         Future?

                                     AUDREY
                         Our family's future.

               This strikes home with Ben. He considers. Wipes tears off 
               Audrey's cheek.

                                     AUDREY
                         Please, let me be your daughter again.

               Ben hold his daughter by the shoulders. Stares into her eyes. 
               They embrace across a decade. Ben's quite moved. Audrey's 
               eyes are cold. She's looking at...

                                                                  :

               AUDREY'S POV

               On Ben's desk Audrey sees the framed photograph of LAURA 
               PALMER.

               RESUME SCENE

               Ben's phone rings. Ben breaks the embrace, goes to the phone.

                                     BEN
                         Ben Horne...
                              (covers the mouthpiece, 
                              to Audrey)
                         I have to take this, sweetheart.

                                     AUDREY
                         Okay. Thanks so much, Dad.

                                     BEN
                         Thank you, Audrey.

               Audrey smiles sweetly and exits. Ben speaks into the phone.

                                     BEN
                         Where have you been?... Meet me down 
                         by the river near the mill pond... 
                         half an hour. Be discreet.

               He hangs up.

                                                                    

                SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Re-establish.

                                                                    

                INTERROGATION A - NIGHT

               Cooper, Truman, Hawk and Andy each stand over one of 
               Lydecker's files.

                                     ANDY
                         Here's a bird, "Louis Armstrong." 
                         He's a parakeet.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Put it with the others.

               He adds it to a small pile in the center of the table. Lucy 
               is heard over the intercom.

                                     LUCY'S VOICE
                         Agent Cooper, I've got Gordon Cole 
                         on the phone.

               Cooper punches Cole up on the speaker phone.

                                     COOPER
                         Cooper here.

                                     COLE'S VOICE
                         Coop, Albert's faxing you his 
                         reconstruction of the plastic object 
                         found in Laura Palmer's stomach even 
                         as we speak.

               Truman gestures to Hawk, who leaves the room to retrieve the 
               fax.

                                     COLE'S VOICE
                         He's also determined the bites and 
                         marks on her shoulders were made by 
                         a parrot or a mynah bird.

                                     COOPER
                         That narrows it down considerably.

                                     COLE'S VOICE
                         That's it, you're up to date.

                                     COOPER
                         Give Albert my thanks.

               He hangs up, as Hawk re-enters with a fax transmission.

                                     HAWK
                         Take a look at this.

               He hands it to Cooper, Truman and he look at it.

                                                                  :

               INSERT: THE FAX

               The fax is a drawing of a POKER CHIP.

                                     COOPER
                         Something with the letter "j."

                                     TRUMAN
                              (putting it together)
                         One-Eyed Jacks?

               A crash from behind them. Andy, holding a card, has dropped 
               a file drawer.

                                     ANDY
                         Harry, Agent Cooper, it's a mynah 
                         bird. A mynah bird owned by Jacques 
                         Renault.

               Truman and Cooper look at each other. Hawk immediately gets 
               on the phone.

                                     COOPER
                              (greatly satisfied, 
                              to the assembly)
                         Gentlemen, when two separate events 
                         happen simultaneously pertaining to 
                         the same object of inquiry, we must 
                         always pay strict attention.

                                     HAWK
                              (on the phone)
                         ...uh huh... has he called in? Thanks 
                         a lot.
                              (hangs up the phone)
                         Renault still hasn't been back to 
                         the Roadhouse.

                                     COOPER
                         Fellas, it's time for a house call.

                                                                    

                RENAULT'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               A rundown apartment building in the Lotown section of Twin 
               Peaks. Truman's cruiser and Hawk's squad car are parked 
               outside.

                                                                    

                RENAULT'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Second floor. Truman, Hawk and Cooper move cautiously down a 
               corridor to the door. Truman is about to knock but Cooper 
               stops him, they listen. Cooper nods, Truman knocks.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Mr. Renault, open the door, please, 
                         it's the police.

                                                                    

                RENAULT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Hearing them, Bobby Briggs climbs out a window and out of 
               the building.

                                                                    

                RENAULT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Bobby jumps down to the ground and runs off.

                                                                    

                RENAULT'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               They hear something from inside. Truman steps back and kicks 
               the door open. He shouts to Hawk as he and Cooper go in.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hawk, outside!

               Hawk runs past them to the window, as Truman and Cooper, 
               guns drawn, check the other rooms. We hear tires SQUEAL from 
               outside.

                                     HAWK
                         Car's going around the side.

               Hawk goes out the window after it.

                                                                    

                RENAULT'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Hawk's car patches out, siren wailing.

                                                                    

                RENAULT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Empty and ransacked, a one-room efficiency plus a small 
               kitchen. Truman's radio squawks.

                         it.

               Cooper is putting on a pair of surgical gloves.

                                     COOPER
                         Harry, let's seal the room and get 
                         forensics.

               Cooper opens a floor level kitchen cabinet. Stashed inside 
               is Leo's BLOODY SHIRT. Cooper carefully lifts it out, looks 
               at the blood, sees initials in the collar.

                                     COOPER

                         Leo Johnson. Leo Johnson and Jacques 
                         Renault.

                         That's the connection we've been 
                         looking for.
                              (looking at the blood)
                         I'll call Doc Hayward, we'll get a 
                         make on this blood.

               Truman's radio squawks.

               Cooper signals a thumbs-up.

                                                                    

                RIVERBANK - NIGHT

               A wooded area by the river. LEO JOHNSON stands by his red 
               Corvette, nervously smoking a cigarette. Looking and waiting. 
               Ben Horne walks out of the woods.

                         Excuse me. I got to take Bernard for 
                         a swim.

               Leo hefts Bernard over a shoulder and walks off

                                                                    

                WOODS CLEARING - NIGHT

               Pitch dark. Then the beam of a flashlight cuts thru the night, 
               moving along the ground.

                                     DONNA'S VOICE
                         But if Mrs. Palmer knows about the 
                         necklace--

                                     JAMES' VOICE
                         How? How could she know?

               Donna and James enter the clearing where they buried the 
               necklace. James lifts the rock.

                                     DONNA
                         She said she saw it, she had a vision 
                         and she said she saw somebody take 
                         it.

                                     JAMES
                              (digging, realizing)
                         Donna, it's not here.

                                     DONNA
                         Then that means someone must have 
                         seen us or followed us here...

                                     JAMES
                         But how did Mrs. Palmer know?

                                     DONNA
                         Laura used to say her mother was 
                         kind of spooky, she used to see stuff, 
                         she'd have dreams. Laura did too.

               An owl hoots. They move closer to one another.

                                     JAMES
                         Maybe we should tell somebody.

                                     DONNA
                         You mean the police?

                                     JAMES
                         If it was the killer, then he knows 
                         that we know

                                     DONNA
                         James, the police didn't love Laura. 
                         Nobody loved her but us.

                                     JAMES
                         I don't want anything to happen to 
                         you. I couldn't stand it, I wouldn't 
                         be able to...

                                     DONNA
                              (giving him strength)
                         Nothing is going to happen to me.

                                     JAMES
                         Just a few days ago we were so happy. 
                         I keep thinking I'm going to see 
                         her, I think I catch a glimpse of 
                         her out of the corner of my eye, 
                         sometimes it's like I really see 
                         her, at school or the Diner...

               James looks away, she takes him by the shoulders.

                                     DONNA
                         James, look at me... we're gonna 
                         find out who killed her. This is 
                         about us. We have to do this for us, 
                         not just for her.
                              (they kiss)
                         I want to be with you...

               They kiss again, more passionately.

                BLUE PINE KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Dressed in her nightgown, Josie answers a ringing phone.

                                     JOSIE
                         Hello?...

                                                                  :

                JACQUES RENAULT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Truman is on the phone. Behind him the apartment is being 
               scaled off with yellow tape that reads "Off Limits - Police 
               Investigation."

                                     TRUMAN
                         Josie, it's Harry, listen, I just 
                         can't get away, we've got a break in 
                         the Palmer case--

                                     JOSIE
                         I miss you, I want to talk to you--

                                     TRUMAN
                         I want to talk to you, too, listen, 
                         Josie, were you at the Timber Falls 
                         Motel today?

               PETE MARTELL enters the kitchen through the back door, 
               carrying the mail.

                                     JOSIE
                              (quietly)
                         I have to go. Call me tomorrow.

               She hangs up. Truman looks at the phone, unsettled.

                                                                    

               ON JOSIE

               As Pete sits at the counter.

                                     PETE
                         Hey, Josie, blow the whistle, it's 
                         quittin' time.

                                     JOSIE
                         Hello, Pete, how did the shift go?

                                     PETE
                              (pops a beer)
                         Cut some wood, made some lumber. I'm 
                         so tired I could...

                                     JOSIE
                         ...eat a horse? I made you a turkey 
                         sandwich.

               Pete goes through the mail as Josie retrieves the sandwich 
               and unwraps it.

                                     PETE
                         Fantastic, Josie. Is Catherine asleep?

                                     JOSIE
                         Yes.

                                     PETE
                         Then gimme some mayo with that.

               Josie smiles and gets out the mayo. Pete heavily lathers his 
               sandwich.

                                     PETE
                         Josie, how do you feel about fish?

                                     JOSIE
                         To eat?

                                     PETE
                         To catch. The Fishing Association's 
                         annual 'do is coming up, you know, 
                         I'm the defending champion--
                              (takes a big bite of 
                              sandwich, as Josie 
                              goes through her 
                              mail)
                         --and this year they're adding a

                         if you're interested, what the heck, 
                         would you like to partner up with 
                         me?

                                     JOSIE
                         Pete, I don't know the first step 
                         about fishing.

                                     PETE
                         Josie, there's enough fishing in me 
                         for both of us.

               A letter, has captured Josie's interest. She doesn't respond.

                                     PETE
                         So, what do you think?

                                     JOSIE
                         Sure, Pete. Let's give it a run at 
                         the money.

                                     PETE
                         Josie, you're my kind'a gal. I'm 
                         going to hit the hay.

                                     JOSIE
                         Sweet dreams, Pete.

                                     PETE
                         Sweet dreams to you, too, Josie.

               Pete exits with his sandwich. Josie opens the letter. She 
               nervously pulls out a piece of paper.

                                                                  :

               THE PHONE

               Right beside her rings. She answers.

                                     JOSIE

                GREAT NORTHERN DALE COOPER'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Through the walls from adjacent rooms we hear whooping and 
               hollering, a blowing of horns and ratcheting noise makers. 
               It sounds like a rodeo in Times Square on New Year's Eve. 
               DALE COOPER sits up in bed, distraught, sleepless. From the 
               bedside table, he picks up his watch and tape recorder.

                                     COOPER
                         Diane, it's 4:28 a.m., I've just 
                         been woken up by the most god-awful 
                         racket, which you can probably hear 
                         over the sound of my voice...
                              (holds up the recorder 
                              to capture the sound)
                         Can you hear that?
                              (holds it up again)
                         I've experienced nothing at the Great 
                         Northern up until this moment but 
                         the most pleasant, courteous service 
                         imaginable, but this only goes to 
                         prove the point that the minute a 
                         traveler leaves home he loses almost 
                         100% of his ability to control his 
                         environment. Diane, I'm wondering if 
                         you could overnight express to me 
                         two pair of those Ear-Pillow Silicon 
                         Ear Plugs I used the last time I had 
                         to visit New York. Naturally I didn't 
                         bring them with me on this trip 
                         because I didn't think they'd be 
                         necessary...

               He holds the recorder up again.

                                                                    

                GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - DAY

               Dale Cooper, dressed and slightly bleary-eyed, enters and 
               takes the corner table. Off screen, through a door to a 
               private dining room, we HEAR a rowdy group of about twelve 
               men and women singing a bawdy Icelandic drinking song. Harried 
               WAITRESSES come and go out of the room, bearing huge platters 
               of food. TRUDY approaches Cooper.

                                     TRUDY
                              (reaching Cooper)
                         Coffee?

                                     COOPER
                         Please.
                              (she pours)
                         What's with the choir practice?

                                     TRUDY
                         Business junket. From Iceland. Got 
                         in about three this morning.

                                     COOPER
                         They're on my floor.

                                     TRUDY
                         Lucky you.

                                     COOPER
                         It'll take them a day or so to reset 
                         their biological clocks.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Hope the herring holds out.

               He holds out his cup for a refill. She pours. The Icelanders 
               start another song

               AUDREY HORNE enters, looking for Cooper, brightens, moves to 
               his table.

                                     AUDREY
                         How are you?

                                     COOPER
                         To be perfectly honest, Audrey, I'm 
                         tired and a little on edge.

                                     AUDREY
                              (sits, saddened)
                         Oh.
                              (hoping for approval)
                         I got a job.

                                     COOPER
                         That's excellent--

                                     AUDREY
                         And I thought maybe now I could help 
                         you with your case, guess where I'm--

                                     COOPER
                              (finishing, rising)
                         You'll have to excuse me, Audrey, 
                         I'm running late this morning, I 
                         only have time for coffee.

                                     AUDREY
                         Maybe I could go with you.

                                     COOPER
                              (leaving change, taking 
                              receipt)
                         Thursdays were traditionally a school 
                         day when I was your age.

                                     AUDREY
                         I can't believe you were ever my 
                         age.

                                     COOPER
                         I've got the pictures to prove it. 
                         See you later, Audrey.

                                     AUDREY
                         See you later. Bye.

               She wistfully watches him go. Digs her nails into her palms. 
               The Icelandic group finishes another song and roars with 
               laughter. JERRY HORNE enters from the private dining room, 
               carrying a small suitcase, laughing, along with the head 
               Icelander, EINER THORSON. Jerry claps Einer on the back, 
               they shake hands and embrace and say something in Icelandic. 
               Jerry turns back to the room and yells to the Icelanders 
               inside...

                                     JERRY
                         My brother is going to love you guys!

               Jerry exits the dining room.

                                                                    

                GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL OFFICE - DAY

               BEN HORNE is behind his desk when Jerry hurries in with his 
               bag.

                                     JERRY
                         I bring you greetings from the 
                         fertile, treeless tundra of Iceland!  
                         Brother Ben, there aren't two twigs 
                         to rub together on the whole island - 
                         wait'll these guys get a load of the 
                         woods!

                                     BEN
                         By six this morning we had complaints 
                         from nearly every guest in the hotel, 
                         what are they on, nitrous oxide?

                                     JERRY
                         I have had more serious fun in two 
                         days with these nordic animals and 
                         Ben, I'm in love, her name is Heba, 
                         she's a giant snow queen with a smile 
                         like sunrise on a ice floe, you could 
                         go blind looking at this girl--look 
                         at this.
                              (takes a large package 
                              out of his bag)
                         You see what she gave me? An entire 
                         leg lamb!
                              (unwraps it; huge and 
                              slightly grotesque)
                         Is that beautiful? Chunk some garlic 
                         in there, some crushed mint: 
                         rotisserie heaven--come on, you got 
                         to meet her--

                                     BEN
                         Let 'em sack out for a few hours 
                         first, now have they approved our 
                         proposal?

                                     TERRY
                              (refers to the 
                              Ghostwood project 
                              map)
                         Ben, hip pocket, glasnost on ice, 
                         they are insane for Ghostwood Estates. 
                         We're on the plane, they're begging 
                         me, "Jerry, please, let us write the 
                         check--you fill in the blanks."

                                     BEN
                         Let's not be eager beavers until the 
                         ink's dry. You grab some down time. 
                         We've laid in a a gala reception for 
                         your fair-haired boys tonight--all 
                         of Twin Peaks best and brightest--

                         --and if we still need a kicker to 
                         nail the sale I'm thinking maybe 
                         they might enjoy a road trip up to 
                         you-know-where.

                         Jacks!

                                     LELAND'S VOICE
                         B-b-ben?

               A haggard, unshaven LELAND PALMER is standing in the doorway.

                                     BEN
                         Leland, what are you doing here?

                                     LELAND
                         I know the new investment group is 
                         arriving today... if there's anything 
                         I can do...

                                     BEN
                         Leland, the best thing you can do 
                         right now is follow the doctor's 
                         orders and go home, you need your 
                         rest--

                                     LELAND
                         I just feel... I just feel I need 
                         something, I need something to... to 
                         occupy my mind...
                              (close to tears)

                                     JERRY
                              (gestures behind 
                              Leland's back)
                         Check-out time.

                                     BEN
                         Take some time off, for god's sake, 
                         fly somewhere, take Sarah--

                                     LELAND
                              (unraveling)
                         I'm afraid to go...

               He crumbles into a chair. From the hallway, we hear the voices 
               of approaching ICELANDERS, singing another ribald song. Jerry 
               nimbly moves to the door and quietly shuts it. Ben tries to 
               hush Leland's sobs. The singers continue singing, directly 
               outside the door now. Then they move on... Ben and Jerry 
               breathe a sigh of relief. Ben points at Leland, then sticks 
               up his thumb, "get this guy out of here."

                                                                    

                APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Re-establish. Police cars parked outside.

                                                                    

                JACQUES RENAULT'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Cooper enters the apartment and is met by SHERIFF HARRY 
               TRUMAN, who is supervising the investigation of the apartment. 
               TROOPERS and two FORENSIC COPS in plain clothes are working. 
               DOC HAYWARD is on the phone.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Morning.

                                     COOPER
                         What've we got, Harry?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Jacques Renault's a Canadian national, 
                         worked the local lumber fields until 
                         he put on a little excess tonnage a 
                         couple seasons ago. That's when he 
                         started tending bar at the Roadhouse.

                                     COOPER
                         Do you have any doughnuts here?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Andy?

               Gestures "doughnut", points to Cooper, to ANDY, who nods and 
               starts out.

                                     COOPER
                         Better wash that down with a cup of 
                         joe, I didn't sleep too well last 
                         night.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (gestures "coffee" to 
                              Andy before he exits)
                         You're looking a little peaked.

                                     COOPER
                         There's a large group of insane men 
                         staying on my floor. Where is Jacques 
                         Renault, Harry?

                                     TRUMAN
                         No one's seen him for two days. We've 
                         canvassed the building and the 
                         Roadhouse, I sent Hawk to roust his 
                         brother but it looks like Bernie 
                         skipped bail; no sign.

               Cooper looks up at a ceiling light fixture, as Doc Hayward 
               hangs up the phone and crosses to them.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Morning, Agent Cooper.

                                     COOPER
                              (still looking up)
                         Doc.

                                     HAYWARD
                         The blood on that shirt you found 
                         here is AB negative. It's not Laura's 
                         blood.

                                     COOPER
                         So that was Jacques Renault's blood 
                         on Leo Johnson's shirt.

               Truman and Doc look at each other. Doc goes back to the phone 
               and dials. Andy returns with Cooper's coffee and doughnut. 
               Cooper takes them, still looking up.

                                     COOPER
                         Thank you, Andy.
                              (takes a bite and a 
                              sip)
                         Could you hold these for a second?

               He hands the coffee and doughnut back to Andy, looks up again.

                                     COOPER
                         Where's Leo Johnson, Harry?

                                     TRUMAN
                         The APB went out last night, nothing 
                         yet.

                                     COOPER
                         Give me a leg up here, would you 
                         Harry?

               Truman cradles his hands, Cooper takes out a pair of calipers, 
               steps into the cradle and Truman boosts his up and out of 
               frame. Doc Hayward hangs up the phone and returns.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Jacques Renault's blood is AB 
                         negative.

                                     COOPER
                              (out of frame)
                         Thank you, Doc.

               Cooper comes back down into frame, gingerly holding a dusty 
               copy of "FLESH WORLD" Magazine in the calipers. He sets it 
               down on a table, blows off some dust and turns pages with 
               the calipers.

                                     TRUMAN
                         "Flesh World" again.

                                     COOPER
                         Harry, remember this ad with the 
                         picture of Ronette Pulaski?

               He turns to the page in question. There's an opened envelope 
               between the pages, with a letter inside. Cooper carefully 
               removes the envelope.

                                     TRUMAN
                         We traced that ad. Came into the 
                         magazine in a plain envelope, no 
                         name--

                                     COOPER
                         Here's how it works. The magazine's 
                         a clearing house. Readers write 
                         letters in response to ads and send 
                         them into the magazine, then the 
                         magazine mails those letters on to 
                         the advertiser. No direct contact.
                              (shows him the envelope)
                         Ronette received her letters at this 
                         P.O. Box.

                                     TRUMAN
                         That's a local zip code.

                                     COOPER
                         My guess is this P.O. box will be 
                         registered in the name of Jacques 
                         Renault. Let's see who was writing 
                         to Ronette. Post marked Georgia.

               He takes out the letter. There are a couple of snapshots 
               inside as well. Cooper, Truman and Doc look at the snapshots.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Good night.

                                     TRUMAN
                         That guy's no Georgia peach.

                         Somehow the beard ruins the effect 
                         of the lingerie, don't you think?
                              (scans the letter)
                         Poor bastard.
                              (folds it up, goes 
                              back to the magazine)
                         By the way, Harry, did you happen to 
                         notice the picture of Leo Johnson 
                         and his truck on this page?

               Points to the picture of a silver truck cab which we saw 
               before.

                                                                    

                JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY

               Leo's truck, the truck in the picture, is parked outside.

                                                                    

                JOHNSON'S KITCHEN - DAY

               SHELLY JOHNSON is serving a hot breakfast to BOBBY BRIGGS. 
               He's dressed, she's in a robe. She sets the plate down in 
               front of him. He eats ravenously.

                                     BOBBY
                         I love when you cook for me.

                                     SHELLY
                         Leo hates my cooking.

                                     BOBBY
                         Leo has missed the boat with you, 
                         baby. The biggest mistake of your 
                         life was dropping out of the eleventh 
                         grade and marrying that roadhog.

                                     SHELLY
                              (amused and excited)
                         What would you do if he walked in 
                         right now?

                                     BOBBY
                              (a hot look)
                         Come here.
                              (pats his leg)
                         Come  here.

               She sits on his leg. He hugs her, kisses her neck, looks up, 
               mock surprise.

                                     BOBBY
                         Hey, Leo, how's it going, man? What 
                         a surprise!

               With a big smile he draws Shelly's nickel-plated revolver 
               out of the pocket of her robe and points it at the imaginary 
               Leo.

                                     BOBBY
                         Now, Leo, Shelly tells me you don't 
                         like her cooking. Tell you what, she 
                         and I, we're going to sit here while 
                         you cook breakfast for us, you 
                         scumbag, and if you so much as say 
                         one harsh word to this beautiful 
                         girl, I'm going to shoot your ugly 
                         face off. Okay, Leo?

               He smiles. Shelly laughs. They hear a car drive up outside. 
               Bobby looks out the window.

                                     BOBBY
                         Sheriff's deputy. Shelly, you tell 
                         him exactly what I told you to, just 
                         like we talked about, okay?

                                     SHELLY
                         Okay.

               The doorbell rings. Bobby kisses her, she goes to the door. 
               Bobby takes the gun and conceals himself in a room off the 
               kitchen. We hear voices.

                                     SHELLY'S VOICE
                         Hi... sure, come on in.

                                                                  :

               BOBBY'S POV

               The living room. Shelly is talking to Deputy Andy Brennan.

                                     ANDY
                         Do you know when Leo might be back?

                                     SHELLY
                         Sorry, he never tells me where he's 
                         going.

               She lights a smoke and sneaks a look back at Bobby. She winks. 
               Bobby smiles.

                                     SHELLY
                         They called and said you were looking 
                         for him, is Leo in some kind of 
                         trouble?

                                     ANDY
                              (looking into the 
                              kitchen)
                         We just need to talk to him.

                                     SHELLY
                         This isn't about Laura or anything 
                         is it?

                                     ANDY
                         Why do you say that?

                                     SHELLY
                         Well, I don't know. I did hear him 
                         talking to this guy the night he 
                         left--

                                     ANDY
                         Which guy?

                                     SHELLY
                         This guy Jacques Renault? They were 
                         outside by Leo's truck, I could hear 
                         'em, from over in the kitchen--

                                     ANDY
                         What did they say?

                                     SHELLY
                         I couldn't hear exactly. They were 
                         arguing but I did hear them mention 
                         her name, then they took off together.

                                     ANDY
                         Shelly, you call us the minute he 
                         gets in touch with you, you be careful 
                         of Leo--

                                     SHELLY
                         You don't have to tell me that twice. 
                         Thanks for stopping by, Andy.

               They move back to the door. Bobby puts the gun in his pocket. 
               Shelly comes back to the kitchen, Bobby grabs her and kisses 
               her passionately.

                                     SHELLY
                         How'd I do?

                                     BOBBY
                         You were great. God, you drive me 
                         crazy.

               The phone rings. Twice. Shelly answers, as Bobby still kisses 
               her.

                                     SHELLY
                         Hello?... hey, Leo, where you calling 
                         from?

               Bobby stops pawing her, gives her another signal. She 
               responds.

                                     SHELLY
                         What's that? Is anybody looking for 
                         you?
                              (Bobby shakes his 
                              head)
                         Leo, what would anybody be looking 
                         for you for?...
                              (Bobby nods, 
                              encouraging her to 
                              continue)
                         Leo, you know how paranoid you get 
                         when you've been popping bennies on 
                         the road a couple days... so, when 
                         you coming home?

               Bobby slips the gun into her hand. She looks at it, looks at 
               Bobby.

                                     SHELLY
                         Everything's fine, come on home, 
                         Leo... I miss you, too.

               She hangs up. Looks at the gun.

                                                                    

                BIG ED'S GAS FARM - DAY

               Establish.

                                                                    

                GAS FARM GARAGE - DAY

               BIG ED HURLEY and JAMES HURLEY are working together on an 
               engine. James is wrestling with some emotional demon. Ed 
               takes notice.

                                     JAMES
                         Mom came home yesterday.

                                     ED
                              (nods)
                         She in bad shape?

                                     JAMES
                         It's getting worse; every time she 
                         goes off on a drunk now, I half expect 
                         her to turn up dead. And part of 
                         me's thinking there's worse things 
                         that could happen.

                                     ED
                         Those are hard thoughts.

                                     JAMES
                              (almost overcome with 
                              emotion)
                         God, I'm... so ashamed of her.

                                     ED
                         That doesn't mean we give up. We 
                         have to keep trying.

                                     JAMES
                         What's left to do? Talk about it 
                         some more? She won't get help, she 
                         won't listen to either one of us--

                                     ED
                         I don't know what else we can do--

                                     JAMES
                         She's killing herself... I don't 
                         want to hate her, Ed, but if she 
                         won't let us help her sometimes I 
                         think it'd be better if she'd just 
                         get it over with...

               His tears finally come. Ed hugs him.

                                     ED
                         I know it's rough. But if we give up 
                         on her, who else is gonna give a 
                         damn?

               A car pulls up out front; we hear it trip the bell wires 
               near the pumps.

                                     JAMES
                              (pulling away, trying 
                              to make light)
                         ...been kind of a rough week.

               He goes out to the back. STAY WITH Ed. We hear a car door 
               open and close. Norma comes into the shop. Too many secrets 
               to rush into each other's arms.

                                     ED
                         Hey, good lookin'.

                                     NORMA
                         I hope you don't mind my coming.

                                     ED
                         No, no, Nadine won't be back from 
                         that patent attorney over in Fairvale 
                         for hours.

                                     NORMA
                         The famous silent drape runners.

                                     ED
                         She's already spending the millions.

                                     NORMA
                         Anyway, I have to put gas in my car 
                         like everybody else, right?

                                     ED
                         Right.

               Pause. Their smiles fade.

                                     NORMA
                         I didn't want to tell you over the 
                         phone. Hank got his parole.

                                     ED
                         Okay.

                                     NORMA
                         He's coming home, I mean back and 
                         I... haven't said anything to him, 
                         yet, I--

                                     ED
                         Hey, you don't have to explain.

                                     NORMA
                         I only saw him for a minute before 
                         we went into the hearing and he seemed 
                         so hopeful, it just didn't seem like 
                         the right time--

                                     ED
                         I understand.

                                     NORMA
                              (Pause)
                         Have you said anything to Nadine?

                                     ED
                              (trying not to lie)
                         I haven't yet, Norma.

                                     NORMA
                              (half-joking)
                         Waiting for me to go first?

                                     ED
                         No. It's just, the more I think 
                         about... Norma, Nadine's not a well 
                         woman.

                                     NORMA
                         What are you saying?

                                     ED
                         I don't know, darling--

                                     NORMA
                              (painfully realizing, 
                              pulling back)
                         I think I do.

                                     ED
                         Maybe the time isn't right, for either 
                         of us right now

                                     NORMA
                         We've only had to wait twenty years, 
                         what's a few more? We can always 
                         hold hands in the nursing home.
                              (almost laughs as she 
                              fights off her tears)

                                     ED
                         I don't ever want to hurt you, Norma.

                                     NORMA
                         Maybe that's our trouble, Ed, we 
                         never want to hurt anybody. We never 
                         just take what we want. But part of 
                         me's beginning to think that's how 
                         you get to the end of your life and 
                         don't have anything to slow for it?

                                     ED
                         Norma...

                                     NORMA
                              (trying desperately 
                              not to cry)
                         Don't call me. Not for a while, okay?

                                     ED
                         All right.

                                     NORMA
                         I love you, Ed.

               She goes. He watches.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                HORNE'S DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

               Establish. A sign on an old, granite facade.

                                                                    

                HORNE'S DEPARTMENT STORE EMPLOYMENT OFFICE - DAY

               Audrey Home is ushered through the doors and directed to sit 
               across the desk by EMORY BATTIS, the department store's forty-
               year old Director of Personnel.

                                     BATTIS
                         Please, please, come in, sit, sit, 
                         can I get you something to drink, 
                         Miss Horne, coffee?

                                     AUDREY
                         Audrey. Call me Audrey. Nothing, 
                         thank you.

                                     BATTIS
                         Audrey, yes, well, call me Emory.
                              (an admiring gaze)
                         My, my, I can remember when your 
                         father used to bring you down here 
                         when you were just a little girl--

                                     AUDREY
                         Did you used to bounce me on your 
                         knee, Emory?

                                     BATTIS
                              (a coughing fit)
                         Doesn't the time just fly right by--

                                     AUDREY
                              (has him pegged; a 
                              turkey)
                         So did my father speak to you?

                                     BATTIS
                         Yes, yes he did, and I can't tell 
                         you how excited we are, Audrey, that 
                         you want to come on board and put in 
                         a hitch with us down here at our 
                         flagship--

                                     AUDREY
                         Thank you--

                                     BATTIS
                         You know, here at Horne's Department 
                         Store we carry on a fifty year 
                         tradition, offering the Northwest's 
                         most elegant shopping experience, 
                         with the widest variety of merchandise 
                         and the friendliest, most courteous 
                         service.

                                     AUDREY
                         Save it for the customers, Emory.

                                     BATTIS
                              (blinks)
                         Excuse me?

                                     AUDREY
                         You don't exactly have to "sell" me 
                         on the place, do you?

                                     BATTIS
                              (nervous laugh)
                         I see your point, indeed I don't, no 
                         siree--

                                     AUDREY
                              (preening)
                         So... what did you have in mind for 
                         me?

                                     BATTIS
                              (looks, then nervously 
                              consults notes)
                         Let's see, let's see, I suppose 
                         driving a delivery truck is out of 
                         the question--
                              (laughs politely, she 
                              pretends to)
                         Well Audrey, per your father's 
                         suggestion, starting low, aiming 
                         high, etc... we thought perhaps the 
                         wrapping department.

                                     AUDREY
                         Wrapping?

                                     BATTIS
                         Boxes, gifts, etc, etc. Part time, 
                         after school.

                                     AUDREY
                         No, no, no, no; Emory, ix-nay on the 
                         oxes-bay.

                                     BATTIS
                         Certainly not the most glamorous job 
                         in the store, but then your father 
                         did specify--

                                     AUDREY
                         Emory, may I speak frankly?

                                     BATTIS
                         Oh please do.

                                     AUDREY
                         Let's talk retail.

                                     BATTIS
                         Sales?

                                     AUDREY
                         Perfume.

               A slight tremor runs across his features. She picks up on 
               it.

                                     BATTIS
                         One of our more sensitive areas. 
                         Expensive items, delicate customer 
                         relations--

                                     AUDREY
                         I'm afraid I've got my heart set on 
                         it.

                                     BATTIS
                              (more than reluctant)
                         I'd have to speak to your father--

                                     AUDREY
                         Emory, here's what we're going to 
                         do. You're going to to tell my father 
                         I'm busy as a bee wrapping boxes 
                         down with the drones and then you're 
                         going to put me to work behind the 
                         perfume counter this afternoon--
                              (before he can speak)
                         --because if you don't I'm going to 
                         rip my sweater in half and scream at 
                         the top of my lungs and tell my father 
                         you made a pass at me. Does that 
                         help clear things up for you? Emory?

               She grabs her sweater, ready to rip and scream.

                                     BATTIS
                         Yes. Yes.

                                     AUDREY
                              (knows what he needs)
                         Yes what?

                                     BATTIS
                         Yes, Ms. Horne.

               She sits back down, demurely arranges herself and smiles.

                                     AUDREY
                         Shall we get started on the paperwork?

                                                                    

                GAZEBO - DAY

               James Hurley is waiting in a park near a lake. DONNA HAYWARD 
               comes around a corner looking for him.

                                     DONNA
                         James?

               He turns, sees her, they embrace.

                                     DONNA
                         I got your note
                              (he still holds her)
                         Are you all right?

                                     JAMES
                         Donna, there's a few things I gotta 
                         say.

                                     DONNA
                         What?

                                     JAMES
                              (extremely difficult 
                              for him)
                         I told you my Dad died when I was 
                         ten?... He didn't die. We were living 
                         in San Francisco. He was a musician. 
                         He was a bum and he ran off and he 
                         left us, me and my mom.

                                     DONNA
                         I'm sorry.

                                     JAMES
                              (a rush of intensity)
                         My mom grew up out here. That's why 
                         we moved back. My mom was a writer, 
                         she was good, poems, short stories. 
                         She's an alcoholic.
                              (looks at her)
                         If you have a problem with this, I 
                         know you didn't ask to hear it...

                                     DONNA
                         I don't have a problem. You tell me.

                                     JAMES
                         It's true she was out of town this 
                         week, but she wasn't traveling. What 
                         she does is, she goes to another 
                         town, shacks up in some cheap hotel 
                         room with a couple bottles and picks 
                         up guys and...

               He's too ashamed to continue. She holds him.

                                     DONNA
                         It's all right.

                                     JAMES
                         I'm telling you this because I don't 
                         want to have any secrets from you, I 
                         don't want there to be any lies 
                         between us. It's the secrets people 
                         keep that destroy any chance they 
                         have for happiness and I don't want 
                         us to be like that...

                                     DONNA
                         We won't. We won't be.

               He kisses her, they hold on to each other.

                                     JAMES
                         We have to do what's right. What you 
                         said yesterday was true; if we don't 
                         do everything we can to figure out 
                         what happened to Laura it'll never 
                         go away, our whole lives--

                                     DONNA
                         We will, James.

                                     JAMES
                         She's out there, wandering like a 
                         restless spirit--

                                     DONNA
                         I feel it, too. We owe it to her.

                                     JAMES
                              (searingly honest)
                         And we owe it to ourselves or else 
                         somehow, someday Donna, she's going 
                         to come between us.

                                     DONNA
                         What can we do?

                                     JAMES
                         I've got an idea. Laura's cousin, 
                         this girl Madeleine, I talked to her 
                         yesterday, I think she could help 
                         us. I want to ask her to meet us at 
                         the diner today, is that alright?

                                     DONNA
                         Yes.

               He kisses her, ready to move off, she stops him, looks him 
               in the eye, strong.

                                     DONNA
                         Count on me, James. No secrets.

               He smiles, kisses her again and runs off to his bike, parked 
               nearby. She watches him go.

                                                                    

                JACQUES RENAULT'S APARTMENT/CORRIDOR - DAY

               CLOSE on a plate of doughnuts as they're passed among the 
               cops working at the scene. STAY WITH Dale Cooper as he takes 
               one and grabs a bite as he looks through some drawers in the 
               kitchen. He's wearing surgical gloves. He takes a bill out 
               of the drawer, lays it thoughtfully on the counter. He opens 
               a cabinet; a red-and-black plaid shirt hangs inside. A number 
               of postcards and photographs are thumbtacked to the inside 
               of the door.

               DEPUTY HAWK arrives, hands a packet of letters to Truman, 
               they cross to Cooper.

                                     HAWK
                         That P.O. box was registered to 
                         Jacques Renault.

                              (looking at the letters)
                         These are all from people responding 
                         to Ronette's ad in the magazine.
                              (look at Cooper)
                         Maybe there's something from someone 
                         we know.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (bothered)
                         There better not be.

                                     COOPER
                              (noticing something)
                         Hawk, hand me that magazine again, 
                         would you?

               Hawk does. Cooper pages through, looking for something.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What is it?

                                     COOPER
                         Those letters are addressed to two 
                         different ad numbers, Ronette's and 
                         another one... here it is.

               Cooper finds the second ad in the magazine.

                                     COOPER
                              (reading)
                         "Young student requires instruction 
                         in the ways of love. Only generous, 
                         mature men need apply."

                                                                  :

               THE MAGAZINE

               The ad features a color photograph of a girl in lingerie, 
               suggestively posed in front of dark red drapes. Her head has 
               been cropped from the photo.

               ON COOPER AND TRUMAN

               Cooper whips out his magnifying glass and examines the photo.

                                     COOPER
                         It's Laura.

                         The drapes.

                         Drapes?

               Cooper opens the cabinet, points to a color photo pinned to 
               the door of a small log cabin in the woods, hands the 
               magnifying glass to Harry. He looks through it at the photo...

                                                                  :

               Through the magnifying glass, red drapes are visible in the 
               windows.

                              he set aside)
                         Can you think of a good reason why 
                         an apartment dweller like Jacques 
                         would buy fifty gallons of heating 
                         oil?

                DOUBLE R DINER - DAY

               Laura's cousin, MADELEINE FERGUSON enters, looks around. 
               James and Donna are seated at a booth.

                                     JAMES
                         Madeleine?

               She sees them, smiles, crosses over. James rises. Madeleine 
               sits across from them. There's a MAN sitting alone in the 
               next booth, his back to them.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Hi. Hi.

                                     DONNA
                         Hi, I'm Donna Hayward.

                                     MADELEINE
                         My friends call me Maddy. This is 
                         really nice of you guys. I don't 
                         really know anybody in town except 
                         Aunt Sarah and Uncle Leland. And the 
                         mood at the house, you can probably 
                         guess, isn't so great right now.

               Donna and James look at each other. James nods.

                                     JAMES
                         Maddy, would you like something to 
                         drink?

                                     MADELEINE
                         A cherry coke would be great.

                                     JAMES
                         You got it.

               James gets up, goes to the counter.

                                     DONNA
                         Madeleine, what we wanted to talk to 
                         you about... if I said you can't, 
                         really say a word of this to anybody 
                         else, not a soul, not even your aunt 
                         or uncle, would that be okay with 
                         you?

                                     MADELEINE
                              (lightly)
                         Sounds like some big secret.

                                     DONNA
                         It is. Madeleine, James and I knew 
                         Laura better than anyone. She was in 
                         some kind of terrible trouble before 
                         she died, worse than any of us could 
                         imagine--

                                     MADELEINE
                              (eyes widening)
                         What?

               James returns with her drink, sits.

                                     DONNA
                         I'd rather not say too much about 
                         things we can't prove yet.

                                     JAMES
                         In some ways, the less you know about 
                         it the better.

                                     MADELEINE
                         You said you can't prove it "yet."

                                     DONNA
                         We loved Laura. We're afraid the 
                         truth might never come out or that 
                         the person who killed her might never 
                         be caught. We've sworn on her memory 
                         not to let that happen.

                                     MADELEINE
                         ...my God. You know who did it?

                                     JAMES
                         We have some ideas.

                                     DONNA
                         We wanted to talk to you because we 
                         need your help.

                                     MADELEINE
                         What do you want me to do?

                                     DONNA
                         Laura used to talk about a hiding 
                         place she had, somewhere in her house, 
                         maybe her room, I'm not sure. Nobody 
                         else knew about it. We think she may 
                         have left something there that could 
                         lead us to the killer.

               Pause.

                                     MADELEINE
                         I'll help you.

                                     DONNA
                         You will?

                                     MADELEINE
                         Absolutely.

                                     JAMES
                         That's great.

                                     MADELEINE
                         You know, I didn't really know Laura 
                         that well, but I feel like I do, our 
                         folks were always telling us how 
                         much alike we were...

               As she speaks, CAMERA MOVES around and behind to the next 
               booth to reveal the Man sitting with his back to them: it's 
               HANK JENNINGS. He's heard the entire conversation. He takes 
               a slow sip of coffee. He's fingering his domino key chain.

               James, Donna and Madeleine rise and start out.

                                     DONNA
                         Will you call me if there's anything 
                         I can do?

                                     MADELEINE
                         I don't think there'll be any problem

                                     JAMES
                         Madeleine, this is really great.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Call me Maddy.

               They're out the door. Hank smiles. A few moments later, Shelly 
               and Norma enter, all dolled up from the beauty parlor, 
               laughing.

                                     SHELLY
                         --God, we look like a couple of 
                         refugee beauty queens.

                                     NORMA
                         Shelly, I don't think you know how 
                         good looking you really are.

                                     SHELLY
                         I sure never felt so glamorous, hope 
                         I don't chip a nail slinging these 
                         plates around--

               They laugh. They pass Hank's booth on the way back to the 
               kitchen.

                                     HANK
                         Hello, Norma.

               She turns and sees him, stops dead.

                                     NORMA
                         Hank...

                                     HANK
                         You look beautiful. You go to 
                         Natasha's?
                              (she nods, can't speak)
                         Surprised to see me?

                                     NORMA
                         Yes.

                                     HANK
                         Got out a day early. Model prisoners 
                         get all the breaks.

               Norma looks at Shelly, who starts back to the kitchen.

                                     HANK
                         Is that Leo's girl?

                                     NORMA
                         Wife.

                                     HANK
                         That Leo. So impulsive.
                              (a friendly remark)
                         Not much meat on her.
                              (a long look)
                         I don't expect a kiss or anything. 
                         Figure I have to earn my way back 
                         into your heart, Norma. But I intend 
                         to try.
                              (another look)
                         So, where do I start?  I'll wash 
                         dishes. Maybe work my way up to short 
                         order one of these days?

                                     NORMA
                         Washing dishes would be fine.

                                     HANK
                         Can I finish my coffee first, boss?

               He smiles and sips his coffee. They look at each other.

                                                                    

               SHELLY

               In the kitchen, looking out at them. The TV is on the kitchen, 
               but the sound is off.

                                                                    

               THE TELEVISION

               A silent scene from "Invitation to Love." MONTANA grabs CHET 
               by the lapels, yells at him, slaps him twice and pushes him 
               to the ground. Chet tries to rise.

               A high-heeled shoe steps onto Chet's chest, pushing him back 
               down. EMERALD. She laughs at him, throws herself in Montana's 
               arms. They kiss.

               Chet looks up at them, stricken. Montana laughs.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

                                       

                                        ACT THREE

               FADE IN:

                DR. JACOBY'S OFFICE - DAY

               We don't immediately realize where we are. Seated in a half 
               circle of chairs are MAJOR BRIGGS, MRS. BRIGGS and Bobby, 
               who can't believe what he's hearing.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         He's been spending more and more of 
                         his time alone in his room.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         It's become much more difficult to 
                         engage him in conversation.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         Terrible mood swings.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         We've been told by the school that 
                         his attendance has become erratic at 
                         best.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         And of course the recent trouble 
                         with public fighting. Both at the 
                         Roadhouse and the funeral.

               And now we see who they're talking to, sitting in a leather 
               chair, nodding sagely...

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Are you using drugs, Bobby?

                                     BOBBY
                         No I'm not.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         Alcohol.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         Alcohol's a drug.

                                     BOBBY
                         That's not what he meant.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         Alcohol doesn't count?

                                     BOBBY
                         Everybody uses alcohol.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Are you unhappy, Bobby?

                                     BOBBY
                         Shouldn't I be?

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         That's not for me to say.

               Pause.

                                     BOBBY
                         Have you ever killed anybody?

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Have you?

                                     BOBBY
                         My father has.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         During wartime.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         That's different.

                                     BOBBY
                         Different from what?

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Perhaps I should spend a few minutes 
                         with Robert alone.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         This is supposed to be family 
                         counseling.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         And I'll need to spend some time 
                         alone with every member of the family. 
                         Bobby first.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         Fair enough.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         Whatever you think best, Doctor.

               The Major and the Missus get up and leave the room.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Bobby, let's cut the crap.
                              (Bobby looks at him)
                         Do you feel that your parents don't 
                         understand what you're going through?

                                     BOBBY
                         That's a good one.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Let's talk about Laura.

                                     BOBBY
                         Okay. Let's talk about Laura.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                              (knows some secrets 
                              here)
                         What happened the first time you and 
                         Laura made love?

                                     BOBBY
                         What the hell kind of question is 
                         that?

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Bobby... did you cry?

                                     BOBBY
                              (stunned; this is 
                              true)
                         Did I what?

                                     DR. JACOBY
                              (also true)
                         What did Laura do then? Did she laugh 
                         at you?

               Bobby's completely throw off his guard. Jacoby moves in.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Were you sad when Laura died?

                                     BOBBY
                         Laura wanted to die.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         How do you know that?

                                     BOBBY
                              (rising emotion)
                         Because she told me.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         What else did she tell you?
                              (silence)
                         Did she tell you there was no goodness 
                         in the world?

                                     BOBBY
                         She said people tried to be good but 
                         they were really sick and rotten, 
                         her most of all, and the harder she 
                         tried to be good the more rotten she 
                         felt because it didn't mean anything, 
                         because every time she tried to help 
                         the world be a better place something 
                         terrible came up inside her and pulled 
                         her back down into hell, it took her 
                         deeper and deeper into the blackest 
                         nightmare and every time it got harder 
                         to go back up to the light.

               Pause.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                              (on the case)
                         Did you sometimes have the feeling 
                         that Laura was harboring some awful 
                         secret?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yes.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Bad enough that she wanted to die 
                         because of it?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yes.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Bad enough that it drove her to 
                         consciously try to find people's 
                         weaknesses and prey on them, tempt 
                         them, break them down, make them do 
                         terrible, degrading things?

                                     BOBBY
                              (shocked and frightened)
                         Yes.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Laura wanted to corrupt people, 
                         because that's how she felt about 
                         herself--

                                     BOBBY
                              (near tears)
                         Yes.

               Pause.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Is that what happened to you, Bobby?

               Bobby dissolves into tears.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                              (gently)
                         Is that what Laura did to you?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yes. She made me... she wanted... so 
                         much... she made me sell drugs so 
                         she could have them... she made me...

               Bobby can't continue, buries his face in his hands. Jacoby 
               has had something essential confirmed. He rises, pats Bobby 
               sympathetically on the shoulder, offers him the bowl of...

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Malted milk ball?

               Bobby shakes his head. Jacoby pops one in his mouth and chews, 
               thinking.

                                                                    

                WOODS - DAY

               A dense, dark forest.

                                                                    

                WOODS - DAY

               A number of police cars parked in a clearing, the jumping 
               off place for a search party. Cooper, Truman, Hawk and Doc 
               Hayward. They're preparing to go off into the woods, when 
               Andy speeds up in his patrol car and gets out.

                                     ANDY
                              (excited)
                         Sheriff, Leo Johnson's been gone two 
                         days, his wife hasn't seen him--

                                     TRUMAN
                         Okay, Andy--

                                     ANDY
                         But the thing is, I looked into the 
                         kitchen? She was having breakfast 
                         and the table was set for two.

                                     COOPER
                         Good work, Andy. You keep those eyes 
                         peeled.

               Andy beams with pride.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Andy, I want you to stay with the 
                         cars.
                              (Andy's disappointed)
                         I need someone to stay near the radio. 
                         We'll keep in touch on the walkies.

               Andy nods and starts back to the cars.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hawk, lead the way.

               Hawk tunes up his sensory apparatus, nods, starts into the 
               woods. Cooper and Truman look at each other. Cooper nods.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Doc, you sure you're up for this?

                                     HAYWARD
                         In for a penny, in for a pound, Harry.

                                     TRUMAN
                         That's the spirit.

               They follow Hawk into the woods.

                                                               

                WOODS - DAY

               A dark, dark grove. The air still and moist. A solitary 
               mournful bird call. Hawk stops, listens, examines the ground, 
               finds something that leads him on. Cooper, Truman and Hayward 
               follow.

                                                                    

                LOG LADY'S CABIN - DAY

               Hawk turns a corner and comes upon a simple, solidly 
               constructed log cabin in a clearing. It is not the cabin we 
               saw in the photograph in Jacques' apartment. Smoke rises 
               from the chimney. The others join Hawk in the clearing.

                                     COOPER
                         Not the one we're looking for.

                                     HAWK
                         Maybe, maybe not.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You might want to hang back a step, 
                         Doc.

                                     HAYWARD
                              (winded)
                         Might want to anyway.

               As a precaution, Hawk and Truman draw weapons and along with 
               Cooper start to advance. As they round the corner of the 
               cabin, they come face to face with the LOG LADY, carrying a 
               log.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hello.

                                     LOG LADY
                         About time you got here.
                              (to herself)
                         They move so slowly when they're not 
                         afraid.

               She goes right inside the cabin. Pause. They look at each 
               other. The Log Lady appears in the doorway again.

                                     LOG LADY
                         Come on then. My log does not judge, 
                         it only records.

               She disappears again. They look at each other. Cooper nods. 
               Truman calls back.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Doc?

                                                                    

                LOG LADY'S CABIN - DAY

               Truman, Cooper, Hawk and then Doc enter. One large room. 
               Simple kitchen, a bed in the corner. Table with six chairs, 
               six places with a log-motif tea setting. A boarded up 
               fireplace. Fire extinguishers and a bucket of water in each 
               corner. An axe, a saw and other woodcutting tools. Framed 
               picture of a lumberjack, on the mantle, beside a funereal 
               urn, with ashes. Log Lady goes to the kitchen, where she's 
               preparing tea.

                                     LOG LADY
                         I've got tea. I've got cookies. No 
                         cake.

                                     COOPER
                         That's very kind of you, but I don't 
                         know if we have time to--

               Hawk signals him to accept the invitation, then takes the 
               lead and sits at the table.

                                     HAWK
                         What kind of cookies?

                                     LOG LADY
                         Sugar. The owls won't see us in here.

               Hayward sits at the table beside Hawk.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Some tea would be very nice.

                                     LOG LADY
                              (to Truman and Cooper, 
                              annoyed)
                         Shut your eyes and you will burst 
                         into flames.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Thank you.

                                     COOPER
                         Thank you very much.

               Truman and Cooper sit. The Log Lady sets down a plate of 
               cookies on the table, along with a log-motif tea pot, then 
               she takes a seat.

                                     LOG LADY
                         We'll let it steep.

               Pause. Cooper reaches for a cookie. Log Lady lightly slaps 
               his hand.

                                     LOG LADY
                         Wait for the tea. The fish aren't 
                         running.

               Cooper. looks around, noticing all the firefighting equipment. 
               She looks at him, as if to say, "Don't laugh. I see everything 
               and it takes it's toll." Pause.

                                     COOPER
                         Do you use fire for cooking then?

                                     LOG LADY
                         I go to great lengths to keep it 
                         under control.

                                     TRUMAN
                         M'am, were you expecting us?

                                     LOG LADY
                         You're two days late. Clues may be 
                         as cold as the tea but that's your 
                         concern.
                              (pause)
                         My log saw something, something 
                         significant. There's no closer 
                         relationship than the logger with 
                         the tree.

               Pause. Cooper looks at Truman.

                                     TRUMAN
                         M'am, what did your log see?

                                     LOG LADY
                              (shakes her head)
                         Drink first and be ready for the 
                         truth..

               She checks the pot, decides it's ready and starts to pour. 
               Six cups. Formal manners.

                                     COOPER
                              (passing the plate 
                              around)
                         Lime, Harry?

                                     LOG LADY
                         My husband was a logging man.

                                     COOPER
                         Oh?

                                     LOG LADY
                         He met the devil. The devil took the 
                         form of fire. Fire is the devil hiding 
                         like a coward in the smoke.

                                     HAYWARD
                              (he knows her)
                         The day after the wedding, wasn't it 
                         Margaret?

               She looks away.

                                     HAWK
                              (to the Log Lady, 
                              comforting)
                         The wood holds many spirits, doesn't 
                         it Margaret?

               She nods. Pause. They nibble on cookies and drink their tea. 
               The Log Lady turns to Cooper.

                                     LOG LADY
                         You can ask it now.

                                     COOPER
                              (to the log; solemnly, 
                              respectfully)
                         What did you see that night? The 
                         night Laura Palmer, was killed?

                                     LOG LADY
                              (pause to the log)
                         Shhhh. Let me do the talking.
                              (she closes her eyes; 
                              this is hard for her)
                         Dark. Laughing. The owls were flying. 
                         Many things were blocked. Laughing. 
                         Two men. Two girls. Flashlights, in 
                         the woods, pass by, over the ridge. 
                         The owls were near. The dark was 
                         pressing in on her...
                              (calmer)
                         Quiet then. A gentle wind. Footsteps, 
                         later, one man pass by. All quiet. 
                         Screams, far away. Terrible. Terrible. 
                         One voice...

                                     COOPER
                              (quietly)
                         Man or girl?

                                     LOG LADY
                         Girl... Further up. Over the ridge 
                         The owl were silent.

               She opens her eyes, blinks. Takes a sip of tea. Hayward dries 
               the tears in his eyes.

                                                                    

                WOODS DAY

               A light mist falls. Hawk, Truman, Cooper and Hayward make 
               their way up the ridge through thick woods.

                                     COOPER
                         The two girls are Laura and Ronette.

                                     TRUMAN
                         The two men Jacques, maybe Leo?

                                     COOPER
                         Maybe.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Who's the third man?

               Hawk stops suddenly, gestures them to be quiet. He listens.

                                     HAWK
                         Do you hear it?

               They listen... Far away... music. An angelic voice, soft 
               chords.

                                     HAWK
                         This way.

               They continue on.

                                                                    

                WOODS SECOND CABIN - DAY

               Hawk, Truman, Cooper and Hayward emerge from a thick stand 
               into a clearing; on a rocky point above them stands the log 
               cabin seen in the photo at Jacques; apartment. Rundown, not 
               well maintained. Red drapes are visible in a window. Cooper 
               looks at the photo. It was shot from the angle they're viewing 
               it from now.

               The music issues from inside the cabin. The song ends. Pause. 
               The same song begins again.

               Truman draws his weapon and takes the lead. Hawk and Cooper 
               draw their weapons and follow. Hayward sits on a rock and 
               wipes his brow with a handkerchief.

                                                                    

                SECOND CABIN - DAY

               The door creaks open, throwing the only light into the dark 
               room. Truman, Hawk and Cooper cautiously enter. The music is 
               louder. Cooper draws aside a set of the heavy, dusty red 
               drapes, letting more light into the room.

               On a simple record player, the tone arm pulled back over a 
               45 record, the song ends again, the stylus lifts, returns to 
               the outside, then back onto the outside edge of the record. 
               Scratches, pops, then the song starts again.

                                     COOPER
                              (under his breath)
                         ...and there's always music in the 
                         air..."

               Cooper lifts the stylus off the record. All three men proceed 
               with extreme care, trying not to move or disturb anything.

               The single room is dusty, trashy, a low-rent version of a 
               harem room: an overstuffed davenport, cheap oriental throw 
               rugs, tasseled satin pillows, empty bottles and full ashtrays.

               On a tripod, a 35 millimeter camera, facing a small photo 
               bay created by the drapes and pillows. Hawk checks it out.

                                     HAWK
                         There's film in here.

               Hawk takes out an evidence bag, removes the film.

               Cooper finds a spool of twine lying on the floor

               Another tripod shaped object, covered with a cloth. Truman 
               slowly draws the cloth off... a mynah bird in the cage reacts 
               drowsily, weak from hunger and thirst. A nameplate on the 
               cage reads... "O"

               Hawk draws their attention to dark stains on the wood and 
               one of the throw rugs. He examines it.

                                     HAWK
                         Blood.

               Cooper moves to look at it.

               Truman, backing up from the cage, hits a rocking chair which 
               rocks forward and hits a table, knocking over a lamp...

               Hawk, looking past Cooper, sees the lamp...

                                     HAWK
                         Watch out.

               Cooper avoids the lamp as it crashes to the floor. Something 
               skitters off the lamp and rolls under the davenport Hawk and 
               Cooper look at each other. Cooper reaches in under the 
               davenport, feels around, finds something. He pulls it out

                                                                  :

               POKER CHIP

               A thousand dollar chip, with a small chunk missing. It reads: 
               "ONE-EYED (J)ACK'S"

               Cooper and Hawk look at each other.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                      

                                         ACT FOUR

               FADE IN:

                GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL BANQUET ROOM NIGHT

               A banner reads:

                 "FROM ICELAND TO TWIN PEAKS: A GREAT NORTHERN WELCOME!!"

               Festive, folksy Icelandic music, plays over the sound system. 
               The reception party is just under way. CITIZENS mingle with 
               the Icelanders, who cluster around the L-shaped buffet. The 
               Horne brothers mingle prominently. At the piano, Trudy leads 
               a group of Icelanders in an Icelandic version of Home on the 
               Range."

                                                                    

                BANQUET ROOM ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               Script above the door reads, "TIMBER ROOM." A HOTEL EMPLOYEE 
               is at the door, checking a guest list as people arrive. PETE 
               and CATHERINE MARTELL reach the door.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Catherine Martell and spouse.

               They're checked off the list and enter. We follow them.

                                     PETE
                         Go easy on the sauce tonight, okay 
                         Cathy?

               She stops a passing WAITER with a tray of champagne. Takes 
               two glasses. Slugs one down.

                                     CATHERINE
                         A few belts and even you might start 
                         to look good to me.

               She knocks back the second one, replaces the glasses on the 
               Waiter's tray, takes another glass and moves off, leaving 
               Pete.

                                                                    

               MAJOR BRIGGS AND EINER THORSON

               The Officer chats up the head Icelander, while they graze 
               from the buffet.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         --of course the modern age has changed 
                         forever the way your people live, 
                         Mr. Thorson, but my guess would be 
                         that there still remains a tremendous 
                         vestigial interest in the legends 
                         and folklore of ancient Iceland.

                                     EINER
                              (smiles, doesn't have 
                              a clue)
                         Vestigial. Absolutely.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         I know, speaking for myself, that I 
                         find these last remnants of a 
                         connection to a natural, more 
                         primitive, almost pagan way of life, 
                         endlessly fascinating; locally, for 
                         instance, we have the Sasquatch 
                         mythos, or Bigfoot, a large, evil 
                         smelling forest-dweller, which I 
                         suppose would correspond to your 
                         "huldufolk" or hidden people.

                                     EINER
                         Trolls?

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         Exactly.
                              (confidentially)
                         I also happen to be a firm believer 
                         in the UFO. I've seen some high-level 
                         classified data that would curl your 
                         hair.

                                                                    

               JERRY HORNE

               Jerry is all agog with the new object of his affection, the 
               tall and beautiful Icelandic girl, HEBA THORSDOTTIR, who's 
               playing with him.

                                     JERRY
                         Heba. Take a bite of that salmon 
                         tartare.
                              (he feeds her)
                         Did you know that was an American 
                         figure of speech?

                                     HEBA
                         No, Jerry.

                                     JERRY
                         "Heba-heba."  You've never heard 
                         that before?

                                     HEBA
                         No, Jerry.

                                     JERRY
                         Do you realize the incredible 
                         potential that could result from our 
                         taking a mutual dip into each other's 
                         respective gene pools?
                              (she doesn't understand 
                              the words, but she 
                              gets his meaning; 
                              they flirt)
                         Heba...
                              (almost a declaration 
                              of love)
                         ...I am going to cook for you.

                                                                    

               CATHERINE MARTELL

               Snaring another drink, she spots Benjamin Home chatting up 
               some Icelanders two clusters away, makes her way to him. She 
               clears her throat, trying to get his attention. He chats on. 
               She does it again. No luck. She deliberately spills her drink 
               on his shoe.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Oh.

                                     BEN
                         Excuse me, gentlemen.

               He takes her by the arm and steers her away. Quiet and angry.

                                     BEN
                         My office, give me two minutes to 
                         break away.

                                     CATHERINE
                              (stops, looks at him; 
                              a threat)
                         "Hell hath no fury..."

                                     BEN
                         What?
                              (he sees her look)
                         Two minutes.

               He moves off. She grabs another drink and heads for an exit. 
               She passes Audrey, who's semi-hiding behind a large wooden 
               column, watching the party with bright, disturbed eyes. 
               Moments later, she watches Ben leave by the same exit. She 
               follows him.

                                                                    

                TIMBER ROOM ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               JOSIE PACKARD enters the room, looks around, a little lonely 
               and out of place. She moves to Pete, who's piling up a massive 
               plate of food at the buffet.

                                     JOSIE
                         Hello, Pete.

                                     PETE
                         Hey, Josie, quite a spread they laid 
                         out, grab yourself some grub.

                                     JOSIE
                              (taking a plate, 
                              looking around)
                         So these are the Icemen?

                                     PETE
                         Somethin' like that.

                                                                    

               LELAND PALMER

               At the entrance, Leland Palmer shuffles into the room. He's 
               pale, clean shaven but sporting a large piece of tissue paper 
               stuck to a shaving mishap on his jaw line. He looks shakily 
               around, wanting very badly to fit in.

                                                                    

                HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Alone in the hallway, Audrey stops at a small secret door, 
               opens it.

                                                                    

                HOTEL WIRING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Audrey moves a short distance down the corridor in dim light, 
               kneels and slides a cover off a drilled peephole and looks 
               into...

                                                                  :

               AUDREY'S POV -  BEN HORNE'S OFFICE

               Catherine pours a drink at the bar, Ben takes the decanter 
               of Scotch from her, pops the top in.

                                     BEN
                         You're impossible.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Tell me again, Ben, tell me what 
                         you're going to do

                                     BEN
                         Speak English.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Tell me how you're going to drive 
                         the mill into the ground, grind that 
                         little Chinese flower to a fine dust, 
                         regain control of my brother's land, 
                         leave your wife and marry me.

               Audrey reacts.

                                     BEN
                         And they all lived happily ever after.

                                     CATHERINE
                              (pleasantly)
                         Look into my eyes, Ben. Do I look 
                         blind to you?

                                     BEN
                         Excuse me?

                                     CATHERINE
                              (still pleasant, takes 
                              out the chip)
                         Why did you have this thousand dollar 
                         poker chip from you know where in 
                         your pants yesterday?

               Ben looks at it, knows he's nailed. Straight-faced.

                                     BEN
                         Jerry gave that to me.

               She slaps him. He calmly pours himself a drink.

                                     BEN
                         It's a good luck charm that I thought 
                         I'd lost. I'm so relieved you've 
                         found it.

               She slaps him again. He sighs.

                                     BEN
                         Are you quite finished?

               She slaps him again. Satisfied, a bit hot.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Yes.

               She hands him the chip. He grabs her and kisses her hard.

               Audrey is laughing so hard she has to cover her mouth and 
               turn away from the peephole.

                                                                    

               BEN AND CATHERINE

                                     BEN
                              (breaking off, 
                              breathless)
                         Not here.

                                     CATHERINE
                              (whispers)
                         Let's burn the mill, let's do it, 
                         tonight.

                                     BEN
                         We'll just slip away from the party 
                         and hope no one detects the smell of 
                         kerosene upon return, no, my love, 
                         we'll give Josie one last chance to 
                         sell.

                                     CATHERINE
                         You'll talk to her.

                                     BEN
                         Tonight. Failing that, I've retained 
                         the services of a qualified 
                         professional.
                              (takes one, offers 
                              one to her)
                         Breath mint?

                                                                    

                HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Audrey comes out the same small door, closes it behind her. 
               She staggers along the corridor, letting out her laughter, 
               big bursts, hysterical and gilded with an edge of desperation 
               and madness.

                                                                    

                KING SALMON ROOM - NIGHT

               Pete stands next to Einer Thorson, the head Icelander, both 
               holding plates of food.

                                     PETE
                         Now let me get this straight; your 
                         entire country is above the timber 
                         line?

               His mouth full of food, Einer nods.

                                     JERRY HORNE'S VOICE
                              (amplified)
                         Folks, ladies and gentlemen, can I 
                         have your attention please?

                                                                    

               JERRY HORNE

               On a one-step riser at the end of the room, at a microphone.

                                     JERRY
                         Can I have your attention please?

               As the crowd congregates towards that side of the room.

                                     JERRY
                         First off, I want to thank you all 
                         for turning out tonight to welcome 
                         our neighbors from the magical island 
                         of Iceland. The Ghostwood Estates 
                         project is an important part of our 
                         future here in Twin Peaks, and there's 
                         no group we'd rather have as a partner 
                         in our future than--

               He's drowned out by the blaring sound of big band music from 
               the speakers.

                                                                    

               LELAND PALMER

               In the middle of the dance floor, he starts to go, a solitary 
               jitterbug. People clear out around him.

                                                                    

               BEN AND CATHERINE

               Re-entering the room. Ben exchanges a look with Jerry, who's 
               panicking. Ben whispers to Catherine.

                                     BEN
                         Dance with him.
                              (she gives him a look)
                         This is serious.

               Catherine moves out towards Leland.

                                                                    

               LELAND AND CATHERINE

               He slickly incorporates her into his dance and they commence 
               to cut a pretty mean rug. Leland is pouring down tears and 
               making little moaning sounds, but the crowd, happily clapping 
               along and half-soused, doesn't pick up those details.

                                                                  :

               BEN AND JERRY.

               Ben makes his way to his brother.

                                     BEN
                         Get Jacoby, get a net, get him out 
                         of my life.

               Jerry nods and moves off. Before he can get very far, he's 
               pulled out onto the floor by Heba and they begin to jitterbug.

                                                                    

               DANCE FLOOR - HIGH ANGLE

               The Icelanders love this new dance craze and spill onto the 
               floor, doing their best to duplicate Leland's style...

                                                                    

               LELAND AND CATHERINE

               Leland picks up his pace. Catherine realizes she's dancing 
               with a man teetering on the edge of a meltdown.

                                                                    

               AUDREY

               Watching from behind a post, away from the dance floor. She's 
               crying.

                                                                    

                PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT

               Establish.

                                                                    

                PALMER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Darkness. Madeleine creeps into the room, wearing a nightgown, 
               carrying a shoe box. A floorboard creaks. She gives a look 
               back upstairs, turns on a lamp, sits, picks up a phone and 
               quietly dials a number. Waits. Whispers.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Donna? It's Maddy... I was looking 
                         in Laura's closet and I couldn't 
                         find anything but I looked up and 
                         noticed there was a loose ceiling 
                         panel?... yes, that was her hiding 
                         place, I pushed the panel back, there 
                         was a shoe box up there...

               She takes off the cover of the box.

                                                                  :

               THE SHOE BOX

               We see four audio cassette tape cases inside. On the top 
               case we can read: "To Dr. Jacoby." There's a noise from 
               upstairs that startles her.

                                     MADELEINE
                         I'll meet you and James tomorrow. 
                         Bring a tape recorder.

               She hangs up, turns off the lamp, puts the cover back on the 
               shoe box and goes back out of the room.

                                                                    

                BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Darkness. Sounds of the party continue elsewhere. As our 
               eyes become accustomed to the darkness, we see someone sitting 
               at Ben's desk and the red glow of a cigarette as they inhale.

               The door opens. Ben enters the room. Josie turns on the lamp 
               at the desk where she's seated. Ben crosses to the desk.

                                     BEN
                         Did anyone see you come in here?

                                     JOSIE
                         No.

                                     BEN
                         You do realize the risk if anyone 
                         sees us.

                                     JOSIE
                         Yes.

               He sits on the edge of the desk. Josie puts out her cigarette.

                                     JOSIE
                         How much longer, Benjamin?

                                     BEN
                         Tomorrow night.

               They look at each other. She slowly extends her hand. He 
               takes her hand and kisses it tenderly. They look at each 
               other.

                                                                    

                LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               LEO JOHNSON pulls up in a beat-up pick-up truck with a covered 
               pay-load, stops beside a small shed outside his half-finished 
               garage. He gets out, looks around, unlocks the shack and 
               starts to load full gas-cans into the back of the truck.

                                                                  :

                JOHNSON'S HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

               A single, small lamp. Shelly, in robe and nightgown, moves 
               into the kitchen, looks out the window at Leo (off-screen). 
               Takes the gun from the table, puts it in her pocket, lights 
               a cigarette.

                                                                    

               LEO

               Secures the tarp back over the gas cans and moves towards 
               the house when he's slugged from behind in the kidneys. He 
               grunts and goes down on one knee.

               A SHADOWY ASSAILANT efficiently, silently and systematically 
               dismantles him, finally turning him and hitting him with 
               three hard right hands to the face. Dazed and bleeding, Leo 
               never knew what hit him. The Assailant grabs Leo by the lapels 
               and pulls him close. The Assailant is Hank Jennings.

                                     HANK
                         You were supposed to mind the store 
                         while I was gone, not open your own 
                         franchise--

                                     LEO
                         Hank--

               A short punch, then...

                                     HANK
                         Do as you're told, Leo. Next time 
                         you'll watch me take your little 
                         chippie apart before I kill you.

               Hank lets him go and disappears.

                JOHNSON KITCHEN - NIGHT

                                                                    

               Shelly, who hasn't heard a thing, finishes her cigarette. 
               Suddenly, Leo bursts in the door behind her, staggering to 
               the sink. turns on the water, his face a bloody mess...

                                     LEO
                         Shelly, call a doctor--

                                     SHELLY
                         Leo, what happened? You all right?

                                     LEO
                              (lashing out)
                         Just call the damn doctor, do as 
                         you're told!

               He backhands her, sends her sprawling. She lands hard. Takes 
               the gun from her pocket.

                                     LEO
                         What are you sitting around for? I 
                         said--
                              (sees the gun)
                         What the hell are you doin' with 
                         that?

                                     SHELLY
                              (taking out the gun)
                         Don't touch me, Leo, don't come near 
                         me--

                                     LEO
                              (laughing)
                         What are you gonna do, Shelly, shoot 
                         me?

                                     SHELLY
                         You're not gonna hurt me again--

                                     LEO
                              (bile seeping above 
                              the pain)
                         You stupid little slut, you don't 
                         even know how to use one--
                              (he advances on her)
                         Besides, you haven't got the guts--

               Shelly closes her eyes and fires. Leo yells, falls back, 
               knocking the lamp off the table. Darkness. Screaming. The 
               front door slams open and shut, the screaming moves outside.

               Shelly huddles in a corner, clutching the gun, terrified. We 
               hear the pick-up truck start and drive off. Shelly tries to 
               catch her breath.

                                                                    

                GREAT NORTHERN CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Dale Cooper rounds the corner, takes out his room key. He 
               stops, listens to the sounds of the still raucous Icelandic 
               party going on downstairs. Cooper sadly shakes his head, 
               starts to unlock his door and realizes it's open. He draws 
               his gun.

                                                                    

                COOPER'S ROOM - NIGHT

               The door stands open, light coming in from the corridor. 
               Cooper enters a moment later, with his weapon drawn. He slowly 
               closes the door, moves in, keeping the gun trained on the 
               bed.

                                     COOPER
                         Reach over slowly and turn on the 
                         bedside lamp.

               There's someone in the bed. The person turns on the lamp. 
               Audrey. Naked under the sheets, eyes red with tears.

                                     AUDREY
                         Don't make me leave. Please don't 
                         make me leave.

               Cooper slowly lowers his weapon.

                                                              

                                         THE END

               FADE IN:

                GREAT NORTHERN DALE COOPER'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Through the walls from adjacent rooms we hear whooping and 
               hollering, a blowing of horns and ratcheting noise makers. 
               It sounds like a rodeo in Times Square on New Year's Eve. 
               DALE COOPER sits up in bed, distraught, sleepless. From the 
               bedside table, he picks up his watch and tape recorder.

                                     COOPER
                         Diane, it's 4:28 a.m., I've just 
                         been woken up by the most god-awful 
                         racket, which you can probably hear 
                         over the sound of my voice...
                              (holds up the recorder 
                              to capture the sound)
                         Can you hear that?
                              (holds it up again)
                         I've experienced nothing at the Great 
                         Northern up until this moment but 
                         the most pleasant, courteous service 
                         imaginable, but this only goes to 
                         prove the point that the minute a 
                         traveler leaves home he loses almost 
                         100% of his ability to control his 
                         environment. Diane, I'm wondering if 
                         you could overnight express to me 
                         two pair of those Ear-Pillow Silicon 
                         Ear Plugs I used the last time I had 
                         to visit New York. Naturally I didn't 
                         bring them with me on this trip 
                         because I didn't think they'd be 
                         necessary...

               He holds the recorder up again.

                                                                    

                GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - DAY

               Dale Cooper, dressed and slightly bleary-eyed, enters and 
               takes the corner table. Off screen, through a door to a 
               private dining room, we HEAR a rowdy group of about twelve 
               men and women singing a bawdy Icelandic drinking song. Harried 
               WAITRESSES come and go out of the room, bearing huge platters 
               of food. TRUDY approaches Cooper.

                                     TRUDY
                              (reaching Cooper)
                         Coffee?

                                     COOPER
                         Please.
                              (she pours)
                         What's with the choir practice?

                                     TRUDY
                         Business junket. From Iceland. Got 
                         in about three this morning.

                                     COOPER
                         They're on my floor.

                                     TRUDY
                         Lucky you.

                                     COOPER
                         It'll take them a day or so to reset 
                         their biological clocks.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Hope the herring holds out.

               He holds out his cup for a refill. She pours. The Icelanders 
               start another song

               AUDREY HORNE enters, looking for Cooper, brightens, moves to 
               his table.

                                     AUDREY
                         How are you?

                                     COOPER
                         To be perfectly honest, Audrey, I'm 
                         tired and a little on edge.

                                     AUDREY
                              (sits, saddened)
                         Oh.
                              (hoping for approval)
                         I got a job.

                                     COOPER
                         That's excellent--

                                     AUDREY
                         And I thought maybe now I could help 
                         you with your case, guess where I'm--

                                     COOPER
                              (finishing, rising)
                         You'll have to excuse me, Audrey, 
                         I'm running late this morning, I 
                         only have time for coffee.

                                     AUDREY
                         Maybe I could go with you.

                                     COOPER
                              (leaving change, taking 
                              receipt)
                         Thursdays were traditionally a school 
                         day when I was your age.

                                     AUDREY
                         I can't believe you were ever my 
                         age.

                                     COOPER
                         I've got the pictures to prove it. 
                         See you later, Audrey.

                                     AUDREY
                         See you later. Bye.

               She wistfully watches him go. Digs her nails into her palms. 
               The Icelandic group finishes another song and roars with 
               laughter. JERRY HORNE enters from the private dining room, 
               carrying a small suitcase, laughing, along with the head 
               Icelander, EINER THORSON. Jerry claps Einer on the back, 
               they shake hands and embrace and say something in Icelandic. 
               Jerry turns back to the room and yells to the Icelanders 
               inside...

                                     JERRY
                         My brother is going to love you guys!

               Jerry exits the dining room.

                                                                    

                GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL OFFICE - DAY

               BEN HORNE is behind his desk when Jerry hurries in with his 
               bag.

                                     JERRY
                         I bring you greetings from the 
                         fertile, treeless tundra of Iceland!  
                         Brother Ben, there aren't two twigs 
                         to rub together on the whole island - 
                         wait'll these guys get a load of the 
                         woods!

                                     BEN
                         By six this morning we had complaints 
                         from nearly every guest in the hotel, 
                         what are they on, nitrous oxide?

                                     JERRY
                         I have had more serious fun in two 
                         days with these nordic animals and 
                         Ben, I'm in love, her name is Heba, 
                         she's a giant snow queen with a smile 
                         like sunrise on a ice floe, you could 
                         go blind looking at this girl--look 
                         at this.
                              (takes a large package 
                              out of his bag)
                         You see what she gave me? An entire 
                         leg lamb!
                              (unwraps it; huge and 
                              slightly grotesque)
                         Is that beautiful? Chunk some garlic 
                         in there, some crushed mint: 
                         rotisserie heaven--come on, you got 
                         to meet her--

                                     BEN
                         Let 'em sack out for a few hours 
                         first, now have they approved our 
                         proposal?

                                     TERRY
                              (refers to the 
                              Ghostwood project 
                              map)
                         Ben, hip pocket, glasnost on ice, 
                         they are insane for Ghostwood Estates. 
                         We're on the plane, they're begging 
                         me, "Jerry, please, let us write the 
                         check--you fill in the blanks."

                                     BEN
                         Let's not be eager beavers until the 
                         ink's dry. You grab some down time. 
                         We've laid in a a gala reception for 
                         your fair-haired boys tonight--all 
                         of Twin Peaks best and brightest--

                         --and if we still need a kicker to 
                         nail the sale I'm thinking maybe 
                         they might enjoy a road trip up to 
                         you-know-where.

                                     LELAND'S VOICE
                         B-b-ben?

               A haggard, unshaven LELAND PALMER is standing in the doorway.

                                     BEN
                         Leland, what are you doing here?

                                     LELAND
                         I know the new investment group is 
                         arriving today... if there's anything 
                         I can do...

                                     BEN
                         Leland, the best thing you can do 
                         right now is follow the doctor's 
                         orders and go home, you need your 
                         rest--

                                     LELAND
                         I just feel... I just feel I need 
                         something, I need something to... to 
                         occupy my mind...
                              (close to tears)

                                     JERRY
                              (gestures behind 
                              Leland's back)
                         Check-out time.

                                     BEN
                         Take some time off, for god's sake, 
                         fly somewhere, take Sarah--

                                     LELAND
                              (unraveling)
                         I'm afraid to go...

               He crumbles into a chair. From the hallway, we hear the voices 
               of approaching ICELANDERS, singing another ribald song. Jerry 
               nimbly moves to the door and quietly shuts it. Ben tries to 
               hush Leland's sobs. The singers continue singing, directly 
               outside the door now. Then they move on... Ben and Jerry 
               breathe a sigh of relief. Ben points at Leland, then sticks 
               up his thumb, "get this guy out of here."

                                                                    

                APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Re-establish. Police cars parked outside.

                                                                    

                JACQUES RENAULT'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Cooper enters the apartment and is met by SHERIFF HARRY 
               TRUMAN, who is supervising the investigation of the apartment. 
               TROOPERS and two FORENSIC COPS in plain clothes are working. 
               DOC HAYWARD is on the phone.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Morning.

                                     COOPER
                         What've we got, Harry?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Jacques Renault's a Canadian national, 
                         worked the local lumber fields until 
                         he put on a little excess tonnage a 
                         couple seasons ago. That's when he 
                         started tending bar at the Roadhouse.

                                     COOPER
                         Do you have any doughnuts here?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Andy?

               Gestures "doughnut", points to Cooper, to ANDY, who nods and 
               starts out.

                                     COOPER
                         Better wash that down with a cup of 
                         joe, I didn't sleep too well last 
                         night.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (gestures "coffee" to 
                              Andy before he exits)
                         You're looking a little peaked.

                                     COOPER
                         There's a large group of insane men 
                         staying on my floor. Where is Jacques 
                         Renault, Harry?

                                     TRUMAN
                         No one's seen him for two days. We've 
                         canvassed the building and the 
                         Roadhouse, I sent Hawk to roust his 
                         brother but it looks like Bernie 
                         skipped bail; no sign.

               Cooper looks up at a ceiling light fixture, as Doc Hayward 
               hangs up the phone and crosses to them.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Morning, Agent Cooper.

                                     COOPER
                              (still looking up)
                         Doc.

                                     HAYWARD
                         The blood on that shirt you found 
                         here is AB negative. It's not Laura's 
                         blood.

                                     COOPER
                         So that was Jacques Renault's blood 
                         on Leo Johnson's shirt.

               Truman and Doc look at each other. Doc goes back to the phone 
               and dials. Andy returns with Cooper's coffee and doughnut. 
               Cooper takes them, still looking up.

                                     COOPER
                         Thank you, Andy.
                              (takes a bite and a 
                              sip)
                         Could you hold these for a second?

               He hands the coffee and doughnut back to Andy, looks up again.

                                     COOPER
                         Where's Leo Johnson, Harry?

                                     TRUMAN
                         The APB went out last night, nothing 
                         yet.

                                     COOPER
                         Give me a leg up here, would you 
                         Harry?

               Truman cradles his hands, Cooper takes out a pair of calipers, 
               steps into the cradle and Truman boosts his up and out of 
               frame. Doc Hayward hangs up the phone and returns.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Jacques Renault's blood is AB 
                         negative.

                                     COOPER
                              (out of frame)
                         Thank you, Doc.

               Cooper comes back down into frame, gingerly holding a dusty 
               copy of "FLESH WORLD" Magazine in the calipers. He sets it 
               down on a table, blows off some dust and turns pages with 
               the calipers.

                                     TRUMAN
                         "Flesh World" again.

                                     COOPER
                         Harry, remember this ad with the 
                         picture of Ronette Pulaski?

               He turns to the page in question. There's an opened envelope 
               between the pages, with a letter inside. Cooper carefully 
               removes the envelope.

                                     TRUMAN
                         We traced that ad. Came into the 
                         magazine in a plain envelope, no 
                         name--

                                     COOPER
                         Here's how it works. The magazine's 
                         a clearing house. Readers write 
                         letters in response to ads and send 
                         them into the magazine, then the 
                         magazine mails those letters on to 
                         the advertiser. No direct contact.
                              (shows him the envelope)
                         Ronette received her letters at this 
                         P.O. Box.

                                     TRUMAN
                         That's a local zip code.

                                     COOPER
                         My guess is this P.O. box will be 
                         registered in the name of Jacques 
                         Renault. Let's see who was writing 
                         to Ronette. Post marked Georgia.

               He takes out the letter. There are a couple of snapshots 
               inside as well. Cooper, Truman and Doc look at the snapshots.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Good night.

                                     TRUMAN
                         That guy's no Georgia peach.

                                     COOPER
                         Somehow the beard ruins the effect 
                         of the lingerie, don't you think?
                              (scans the letter)
                         Poor bastard.
                              (folds it up, goes 
                              back to the magazine)
                         By the way, Harry, did you happen to 
                         notice the picture of Leo Johnson 
                         and his truck on this page?

               Points to the picture of a silver truck cab which we saw 
               before.

                                                                    

                JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY

               Leo's truck, the truck in the picture, is parked outside.

                                                                    

                JOHNSON'S KITCHEN - DAY

               SHELLY JOHNSON is serving a hot breakfast to BOBBY BRIGGS. 
               He's dressed, she's in a robe. She sets the plate down in 
               front of him. He eats ravenously.

                                     BOBBY
                         I love when you cook for me.

                                     SHELLY
                         Leo hates my cooking.

                                     BOBBY
                         Leo has missed the boat with you, 
                         baby. The biggest mistake of your 
                         life was dropping out of the eleventh 
                         grade and marrying that roadhog.

                                     SHELLY
                              (amused and excited)
                         What would you do if he walked in 
                         right now?

                                     BOBBY
                              (a hot look)
                         Come here.
                              (pats his leg)
                         Come  here.

               She sits on his leg. He hugs her, kisses her neck, looks up, 
               mock surprise.

                                     BOBBY
                         Hey, Leo, how's it going, man? What 
                         a surprise!

               With a big smile he draws Shelly's nickel-plated revolver 
               out of the pocket of her robe and points it at the imaginary 
               Leo.

                                     BOBBY
                         Now, Leo, Shelly tells me you don't 
                         like her cooking. Tell you what, she 
                         and I, we're going to sit here while 
                         you cook breakfast for us, you 
                         scumbag, and if you so much as say 
                         one harsh word to this beautiful 
                         girl, I'm going to shoot your ugly 
                         face off. Okay, Leo?

               He smiles. Shelly laughs. They hear a car drive up outside. 
               Bobby looks out the window.

                                     BOBBY
                         Sheriff's deputy. Shelly, you tell 
                         him exactly what I told you to, just 
                         like we talked about, okay?

                                     SHELLY
                         Okay.

               The doorbell rings. Bobby kisses her, she goes to the door. 
               Bobby takes the gun and conceals himself in a room off the 
               kitchen. We hear voices.

                                     SHELLY'S VOICE
                         Hi... sure, come on in.

                                                                  :

               BOBBY'S POV

               The living room. Shelly is talking to Deputy Andy Brennan.

                                     ANDY
                         Do you know when Leo might be back?

                                     SHELLY
                         Sorry, he never tells me where he's 
                         going.

               She lights a smoke and sneaks a look back at Bobby. She winks. 
               Bobby smiles.

                                     SHELLY
                         They called and said you were looking 
                         for him, is Leo in some kind of 
                         trouble?

                                     ANDY
                              (looking into the 
                              kitchen)
                         We just need to talk to him.

                                     SHELLY
                         This isn't about Laura or anything 
                         is it?

                                     ANDY
                         Why do you say that?

                                     SHELLY
                         Well, I don't know. I did hear him 
                         talking to this guy the night he 
                         left--

                                     ANDY
                         Which guy?

                                     SHELLY
                         This guy Jacques Renault? They were 
                         outside by Leo's truck, I could hear 
                         'em, from over in the kitchen--

                                     ANDY
                         What did they say?

                                     SHELLY
                         I couldn't hear exactly. They were 
                         arguing but I did hear them mention 
                         her name, then they took off together.

                                     ANDY
                         Shelly, you call us the minute he 
                         gets in touch with you, you be careful 
                         of Leo--

                                     SHELLY
                         You don't have to tell me that twice. 
                         Thanks for stopping by, Andy.

               They move back to the door. Bobby puts the gun in his pocket. 
               Shelly comes back to the kitchen, Bobby grabs her and kisses 
               her passionately.

                                     SHELLY
                         How'd I do?

                                     BOBBY
                         You were great. God, you drive me 
                         crazy.

               The phone rings. Twice. Shelly answers, as Bobby still kisses 
               her.

                                     SHELLY
                         Hello?... hey, Leo, where you calling 
                         from?

               Bobby stops pawing her, gives her another signal. She 
               responds.

                                     SHELLY
                         What's that? Is anybody looking for 
                         you?
                              (Bobby shakes his 
                              head)
                         Leo, what would anybody be looking 
                         for you for?...
                              (Bobby nods, 
                              encouraging her to 
                              continue)
                         Leo, you know how paranoid you get 
                         when you've been popping bennies on 
                         the road a couple days... so, when 
                         you coming home?

               Bobby slips the gun into her hand. She looks at it, looks at 
               Bobby.

                                     SHELLY
                         Everything's fine, come on home, 
                         Leo... I miss you, too.

               She hangs up. Looks at the gun.

                                                                    

                BIG ED'S GAS FARM - DAY

               Establish.

                                                                    

                GAS FARM GARAGE - DAY

               BIG ED HURLEY and JAMES HURLEY are working together on an 
               engine. James is wrestling with some emotional demon. Ed 
               takes notice.

                                     JAMES
                         Mom came home yesterday.

                                     ED
                              (nods)
                         She in bad shape?

                                     JAMES
                         It's getting worse; every time she 
                         goes off on a drunk now, I half expect 
                         her to turn up dead. And part of 
                         me's thinking there's worse things 
                         that could happen.

                                     ED
                         Those are hard thoughts.

                                     JAMES
                              (almost overcome with 
                              emotion)
                         God, I'm... so ashamed of her.

                                     ED
                         That doesn't mean we give up. We 
                         have to keep trying.

                                     JAMES
                         What's left to do? Talk about it 
                         some more? She won't get help, she 
                         won't listen to either one of us--

                                     ED
                         I don't know what else we can do--

                                     JAMES
                         She's killing herself... I don't 
                         want to hate her, Ed, but if she 
                         won't let us help her sometimes I 
                         think it'd be better if she'd just 
                         get it over with...

               His tears finally come. Ed hugs him.

                                     ED
                         I know it's rough. But if we give up 
                         on her, who else is gonna give a 
                         damn?

               A car pulls up out front; we hear it trip the bell wires 
               near the pumps.

                                     JAMES
                              (pulling away, trying 
                              to make light)
                         ...been kind of a rough week.

               He goes out to the back. STAY WITH Ed. We hear a car door 
               open and close. Norma comes into the shop. Too many secrets 
               to rush into each other's arms.

                                     ED
                         Hey, good lookin'.

                                     NORMA
                         I hope you don't mind my coming.

                                     ED
                         No, no, Nadine won't be back from 
                         that patent attorney over in Fairvale 
                         for hours.

                                     NORMA
                         The famous silent drape runners.

                                     ED
                         She's already spending the millions.

                                     NORMA
                         Anyway, I have to put gas in my car 
                         like everybody else, right?

                                     ED
                         Right.

               Pause. Their smiles fade.

                                     NORMA
                         I didn't want to tell you over the 
                         phone. Hank got his parole.

                                     ED
                         Okay.

                                     NORMA
                         He's coming home, I mean back and 
                         I... haven't said anything to him, 
                         yet, I--

                                     ED
                         Hey, you don't have to explain.

                                     NORMA
                         I only saw him for a minute before 
                         we went into the hearing and he seemed 
                         so hopeful, it just didn't seem like 
                         the right time--

                                     ED
                         I understand.

                                     NORMA
                              (Pause)
                         Have you said anything to Nadine?

                                     ED
                              (trying not to lie)
                         I haven't yet, Norma.

                                     NORMA
                              (half-joking)
                         Waiting for me to go first?

                                     ED
                         No. It's just, the more I think 
                         about... Norma, Nadine's not a well 
                         woman.

                                     NORMA
                         What are you saying?

                                     ED
                         I don't know, darling--

                                     NORMA
                              (painfully realizing, 
                              pulling back)
                         I think I do.

                                     ED
                         Maybe the time isn't right, for either 
                         of us right now

                         We've only had to wait twenty years, 
                         what's a few more? We can always 
                         hold hands in the nursing home.
                              (almost laughs as she 
                              fights off her tears)

                                     ED
                         I don't ever want to hurt you, Norma.

                                     NORMA
                         Maybe that's our trouble, Ed, we 
                         never want to hurt anybody. We never 
                         just take what we want. But part of 
                         me's beginning to think that's how 
                         you get to the end of your life and 
                         don't have anything to slow for it?

                                     ED
                         Norma...

                                     NORMA
                              (trying desperately 
                              not to cry)
                         Don't call me. Not for a while, okay?

                                     ED
                         All right.

                                     NORMA
                         I love you, Ed.

               She goes. He watches.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                HORNE'S DEPARTMENT STORE EMPLOYMENT OFFICE - DAY

               Audrey Home is ushered through the doors and directed to sit 
               across the desk by EMORY BATTIS, the department store's forty-
               year old Director of Personnel.

                                     BATTIS
                         Please, please, come in, sit, sit, 
                         can I get you something to drink, 
                         Miss Horne, coffee?

                                     AUDREY
                         Audrey. Call me Audrey. Nothing, 
                         thank you.

                                     BATTIS
                         Audrey, yes, well, call me Emory.
                              (an admiring gaze)
                         My, my, I can remember when your 
                         father used to bring you down here 
                         when you were just a little girl--

                                     AUDREY
                         Did you used to bounce me on your 
                         knee, Emory?

                                     BATTIS
                              (a coughing fit)
                         Doesn't the time just fly right by--

                                     AUDREY
                              (has him pegged; a 
                              turkey)
                         So did my father speak to you?

                                     BATTIS
                         Yes, yes he did, and I can't tell 
                         you how excited we are, Audrey, that 
                         you want to come on board and put in 
                         a hitch with us down here at our 
                         flagship--

                                     AUDREY
                         Thank you--

                                     BATTIS
                         You know, here at Horne's Department 
                         Store we carry on a fifty year 
                         tradition, offering the Northwest's 
                         most elegant shopping experience, 
                         with the widest variety of merchandise 
                         and the friendliest, most courteous 
                         service.

                                     AUDREY
                         Save it for the customers, Emory.

                                     BATTIS
                              (blinks)
                         Excuse me?

                                     AUDREY
                         You don't exactly have to "sell" me 
                         on the place, do you?

                                     BATTIS
                              (nervous laugh)
                         I see your point, indeed I don't, no 
                         siree--

                                     AUDREY
                              (preening)
                         So... what did you have in mind for 
                         me?

                                     BATTIS
                              (looks, then nervously 
                              consults notes)
                         Let's see, let's see, I suppose 
                         driving a delivery truck is out of 
                         the question--
                              (laughs politely, she 
                              pretends to)
                         Well Audrey, per your father's 
                         suggestion, starting low, aiming 
                         high, etc... we thought perhaps the 
                         wrapping department.

                                     AUDREY
                         Wrapping?

                                     BATTIS
                         Boxes, gifts, etc, etc. Part time, 
                         after school.

                                     AUDREY
                         No, no, no, no; Emory, ix-nay on the 
                         oxes-bay.

                                     BATTIS
                         Certainly not the most glamorous job 
                         in the store, but then your father 
                         did specify--

                                     AUDREY
                         Emory, may I speak frankly?

                                     BATTIS
                         Oh please do.

                                     AUDREY
                         Let's talk retail.

                                     BATTIS
                         Sales?

                                     AUDREY
                         Perfume.

               A slight tremor runs across his features. She picks up on 
               it.

                                     BATTIS
                         One of our more sensitive areas. 
                         Expensive items, delicate customer 
                         relations--

                                     AUDREY
                         I'm afraid I've got my heart set on 
                         it.

                                     BATTIS
                              (more than reluctant)
                         I'd have to speak to your father--

                                     AUDREY
                         Emory, here's what we're going to 
                         do. You're going to to tell my father 
                         I'm busy as a bee wrapping boxes 
                         down with the drones and then you're 
                         going to put me to work behind the 
                         perfume counter this afternoon--
                              (before he can speak)
                         --because if you don't I'm going to 
                         rip my sweater in half and scream at 
                         the top of my lungs and tell my father 
                         you made a pass at me. Does that 
                         help clear things up for you? Emory?

               She grabs her sweater, ready to rip and scream.

                                     BATTIS
                         Yes. Yes.

                                     AUDREY
                              (knows what he needs)
                         Yes what?

                                     BATTIS
                         Yes, Ms. Horne.

               She sits back down, demurely arranges herself and smiles.

                                     AUDREY
                         Shall we get started on the paperwork?

                                                                    

                GAZEBO - DAY

               James Hurley is waiting in a park near a lake. DONNA HAYWARD 
               comes around a corner looking for him.

                                     DONNA
                         James?

               He turns, sees her, they embrace.

                                     DONNA
                         I got your note
                              (he still holds her)
                         Are you all right?

                                     JAMES
                         Donna, there's a few things I gotta 
                         say.

                                     DONNA
                         What?

                                     JAMES
                              (extremely difficult 
                              for him)
                         I told you my Dad died when I was 
                         ten?... He didn't die. We were living 
                         in San Francisco. He was a musician. 
                         He was a bum and he ran off and he 
                         left us, me and my mom.

                                     DONNA
                         I'm sorry.

                                     JAMES
                              (a rush of intensity)
                         My mom grew up out here. That's why 
                         we moved back. My mom was a writer, 
                         she was good, poems, short stories. 
                         She's an alcoholic.
                              (looks at her)
                         If you have a problem with this, I 
                         know you didn't ask to hear it...

                                     DONNA
                         I don't have a problem. You tell me.

                                     JAMES
                         It's true she was out of town this 
                         week, but she wasn't traveling. What 
                         she does is, she goes to another 
                         town, shacks up in some cheap hotel 
                         room with a couple bottles and picks 
                         up guys and...

               He's too ashamed to continue. She holds him.

                                     DONNA
                         It's all right.

                                     JAMES
                         I'm telling you this because I don't 
                         want to have any secrets from you, I 
                         don't want there to be any lies 
                         between us. It's the secrets people 
                         keep that destroy any chance they 
                         have for happiness and I don't want 
                         us to be like that...

                                     DONNA
                         We won't. We won't be.

               He kisses her, they hold on to each other.

                                     JAMES
                         We have to do what's right. What you 
                         said yesterday was true; if we don't 
                         do everything we can to figure out 
                         what happened to Laura it'll never 
                         go away, our whole lives--

                                     DONNA
                         We will, James.

                                     JAMES
                         She's out there, wandering like a 
                         restless spirit--

                                     DONNA
                         I feel it, too. We owe it to her.

                                     JAMES
                              (searingly honest)
                         And we owe it to ourselves or else 
                         somehow, someday Donna, she's going 
                         to come between us.

                                     DONNA
                         What can we do?

                                     JAMES
                         I've got an idea. Laura's cousin, 
                         this girl Madeleine, I talked to her 
                         yesterday, I think she could help 
                         us. I want to ask her to meet us at 
                         the diner today, is that alright?

                                     DONNA
                         Yes.

               He kisses her, ready to move off, she stops him, looks him 
               in the eye, strong.

                                     DONNA
                         Count on me, James. No secrets.

               He smiles, kisses her again and runs off to his bike, parked 
               nearby. She watches him go.

                                                                    

                JACQUES RENAULT'S APARTMENT/CORRIDOR - DAY

               CLOSE on a plate of doughnuts as they're passed among the 
               cops working at the scene. STAY WITH Dale Cooper as he takes 
               one and grabs a bite as he looks through some drawers in the 
               kitchen. He's wearing surgical gloves. He takes a bill out 
               of the drawer, lays it thoughtfully on the counter. He opens 
               a cabinet; a red-and-black plaid shirt hangs inside. A number 
               of postcards and photographs are thumbtacked to the inside 
               of the door.

               DEPUTY HAWK arrives, hands a packet of letters to Truman, 
               they cross to Cooper.

                         These are all from people responding 
                         to Ronette's ad in the magazine.
                              (look at Cooper)
                         Maybe there's something from someone 
                         we know.

                              (noticing something)
                         Hawk, hand me that magazine again, 
                         would you?

               Hawk does. Cooper pages through, looking for something.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What is it?

                                     COOPER
                         Those letters are addressed to two 
                         different ad numbers, Ronette's and 
                         another one... here it is.

               Cooper finds the second ad in the magazine.

                                     COOPER
                              (reading)
                         "Young student requires instruction 
                         in the ways of love. Only generous, 
                         mature men need apply."

                                                                  :

               THE MAGAZINE

               The ad features a color photograph of a girl in lingerie, 
               suggestively posed in front of dark red drapes. Her head has 
               been cropped from the photo.

               Cooper whips out his magnifying glass and examines the photo.

                         It's Laura.

               Cooper opens the cabinet, points to a color photo pinned to 
               the door of a small log cabin in the woods, hands the 
               magnifying glass to Harry. He looks through it at the photo...

                                                                  :

                         Can you think of a good reason why 
                         an apartment dweller like Jacques 
                         would buy fifty gallons of heating

                DOUBLE R DINER - DAY

               Laura's cousin, MADELEINE FERGUSON enters, looks around. 
               James and Donna are seated at a booth.

                                     JAMES
                         Madeleine?

               She sees them, smiles, crosses over. James rises. Madeleine 
               sits across from them. There's a MAN sitting alone in the 
               next booth, his back to them.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Hi. Hi.

                                     DONNA
                         Hi, I'm Donna Hayward.

                                     MADELEINE
                         My friends call me Maddy. This is 
                         really nice of you guys. I don't 
                         really know anybody in town except 
                         Aunt Sarah and Uncle Leland. And the 
                         mood at the house, you can probably 
                         guess, isn't so great right now.

               Donna and James look at each other. James nods.

                                     JAMES
                         Maddy, would you like something to 
                         drink?

                                     MADELEINE
                         A cherry coke would be great.

                                     JAMES
                         You got it.

               James gets up, goes to the counter.

                                     DONNA
                         Madeleine, what we wanted to talk to 
                         you about... if I said you can't, 
                         really say a word of this to anybody 
                         else, not a soul, not even your aunt 
                         or uncle, would that be okay with 
                         you?

                                     MADELEINE
                              (lightly)
                         Sounds like some big secret.

                                     DONNA
                         It is. Madeleine, James and I knew 
                         Laura better than anyone. She was in 
                         some kind of terrible trouble before 
                         she died, worse than any of us could 
                         imagine--

                                     MADELEINE
                              (eyes widening)
                         What?

               James returns with her drink, sits.

                                     DONNA
                         I'd rather not say too much about 
                         things we can't prove yet.

                                     JAMES
                         In some ways, the less you know about 
                         it the better.

                                     MADELEINE
                         You said you can't prove it "yet."

                                     DONNA
                         We loved Laura. We're afraid the 
                         truth might never come out or that 
                         the person who killed her might never 
                         be caught. We've sworn on her memory 
                         not to let that happen.

                                     MADELEINE
                         ...my God. You know who did it?

                                     JAMES
                         We have some ideas.

                                     DONNA
                         We wanted to talk to you because we 
                         need your help.

                                     MADELEINE
                         What do you want me to do?

                                     DONNA
                         Laura used to talk about a hiding 
                         place she had, somewhere in her house, 
                         maybe her room, I'm not sure. Nobody 
                         else knew about it. We think she may 
                         have left something there that could 
                         lead us to the killer.

               Pause.

                                     MADELEINE
                         I'll help you.

                                     DONNA
                         You will?

                                     MADELEINE
                         Absolutely.

                                     JAMES
                         That's great.

                                     MADELEINE
                         You know, I didn't really know Laura 
                         that well, but I feel like I do, our 
                         folks were always telling us how 
                         much alike we were...

               As she speaks, CAMERA MOVES around and behind to the next 
               booth to reveal the Man sitting with his back to them: it's 
               HANK JENNINGS. He's heard the entire conversation. He takes 
               a slow sip of coffee. He's fingering his domino key chain.

               James, Donna and Madeleine rise and start out.

                                     DONNA
                         Will you call me if there's anything 
                         I can do?

                                     MADELEINE
                         I don't think there'll be any problem

                                     JAMES
                         Madeleine, this is really great.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Call me Maddy.

               They're out the door. Hank smiles. A few moments later, Shelly 
               and Norma enter, all dolled up from the beauty parlor, 
               laughing.

                                     SHELLY
                         --God, we look like a couple of 
                         refugee beauty queens.

                                     NORMA
                         Shelly, I don't think you know how 
                         good looking you really are.

                                     SHELLY
                         I sure never felt so glamorous, hope 
                         I don't chip a nail slinging these 
                         plates around--

               They laugh. They pass Hank's booth on the way back to the 
               kitchen.

                                     HANK
                         Hello, Norma.

               She turns and sees him, stops dead.

                                     NORMA
                         Hank...

                                     HANK
                         You look beautiful. You go to 
                         Natasha's?
                              (she nods, can't speak)
                         Surprised to see me?

                                     NORMA
                         Yes.

                                     HANK
                         Got out a day early. Model prisoners 
                         get all the breaks.

               Norma looks at Shelly, who starts back to the kitchen.

                                     HANK
                         Is that Leo's girl?

                                     NORMA
                         Wife.

                                     HANK
                         That Leo. So impulsive.
                              (a friendly remark)
                         Not much meat on her.
                              (a long look)
                         I don't expect a kiss or anything. 
                         Figure I have to earn my way back 
                         into your heart, Norma. But I intend 
                         to try.
                              (another look)
                         So, where do I start?  I'll wash 
                         dishes. Maybe work my way up to short 
                         order one of these days?

                                     NORMA
                         Washing dishes would be fine.

                                     HANK
                         Can I finish my coffee first, boss?

               He smiles and sips his coffee. They look at each other.

                                                                    

               SHELLY

               In the kitchen, looking out at them. The TV is on the kitchen, 
               but the sound is off.

                                                                    

               THE TELEVISION

               A silent scene from "Invitation to Love." MONTANA grabs CHET 
               by the lapels, yells at him, slaps him twice and pushes him 
               to the ground. Chet tries to rise.

               A high-heeled shoe steps onto Chet's chest, pushing him back 
               down. EMERALD. She laughs at him, throws herself in Montana's 
               arms. They kiss.

               Chet looks up at them, stricken. Montana laughs.

               FADE IN:

                DR. JACOBY'S OFFICE - DAY

               We don't immediately realize where we are. Seated in a half 
               circle of chairs are MAJOR BRIGGS, MRS. BRIGGS and Bobby, 
               who can't believe what he's hearing.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         He's been spending more and more of 
                         his time alone in his room.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         It's become much more difficult to 
                         engage him in conversation.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         Terrible mood swings.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         We've been told by the school that 
                         his attendance has become erratic at 
                         best.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         And of course the recent trouble 
                         with public fighting. Both at the 
                         Roadhouse and the funeral.

               And now we see who they're talking to, sitting in a leather 
               chair, nodding sagely...

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Are you using drugs, Bobby?

                                     BOBBY
                         No I'm not.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         Alcohol.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         Alcohol's a drug.

                                     BOBBY
                         That's not what he meant.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         Alcohol doesn't count?

                                     BOBBY
                         Everybody uses alcohol.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Are you unhappy, Bobby?

                                     BOBBY
                         Shouldn't I be?

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         That's not for me to say.

               Pause.

                                     BOBBY
                         Have you ever killed anybody?

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Have you?

                                     BOBBY
                         My father has.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         During wartime.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         That's different.

                                     BOBBY
                         Different from what?

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Perhaps I should spend a few minutes 
                         with Robert alone.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         This is supposed to be family 
                         counseling.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         And I'll need to spend some time 
                         alone with every member of the family. 
                         Bobby first.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         Fair enough.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         Whatever you think best, Doctor.

               The Major and the Missus get up and leave the room.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Bobby, let's cut the crap.
                              (Bobby looks at him)
                         Do you feel that your parents don't 
                         understand what you're going through?

                                     BOBBY
                         That's a good one.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Let's talk about Laura.

                                     BOBBY
                         Okay. Let's talk about Laura.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                              (knows some secrets 
                              here)
                         What happened the first time you and 
                         Laura made love?

                                     BOBBY
                         What the hell kind of question is 
                         that?

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Bobby... did you cry?

                                     BOBBY
                              (stunned; this is 
                              true)
                         Did I what?

                                     DR. JACOBY
                              (also true)
                         What did Laura do then? Did she laugh 
                         at you?

               Bobby's completely throw off his guard. Jacoby moves in.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Were you sad when Laura died?

                                     BOBBY
                         Laura wanted to die.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         How do you know that?

                                     BOBBY
                              (rising emotion)
                         Because she told me.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         What else did she tell you?
                              (silence)
                         Did she tell you there was no goodness 
                         in the world?

                                     BOBBY
                         She said people tried to be good but 
                         they were really sick and rotten, 
                         her most of all, and the harder she 
                         tried to be good the more rotten she 
                         felt because it didn't mean anything, 
                         because every time she tried to help 
                         the world be a better place something 
                         terrible came up inside her and pulled 
                         her back down into hell, it took her 
                         deeper and deeper into the blackest 
                         nightmare and every time it got harder 
                         to go back up to the light.

               Pause.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                              (on the case)
                         Did you sometimes have the feeling 
                         that Laura was harboring some awful 
                         secret?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yes.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Bad enough that she wanted to die 
                         because of it?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yes.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Bad enough that it drove her to 
                         consciously try to find people's 
                         weaknesses and prey on them, tempt 
                         them, break them down, make them do 
                         terrible, degrading things?

                                     BOBBY
                              (shocked and frightened)
                         Yes.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Laura wanted to corrupt people, 
                         because that's how she felt about 
                         herself--

                                     BOBBY
                              (near tears)
                         Yes.

               Pause.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Is that what happened to you, Bobby?

               Bobby dissolves into tears.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                              (gently)
                         Is that what Laura did to you?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yes. She made me... she wanted... so 
                         much... she made me sell drugs so 
                         she could have them... she made me...

               Bobby can't continue, buries his face in his hands. Jacoby 
               has had something essential confirmed. He rises, pats Bobby 
               sympathetically on the shoulder, offers him the bowl of...

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Malted milk ball?

               Bobby shakes his head. Jacoby pops one in his mouth and chews, 
               thinking.

                                                                    

                WOODS - DAY

               A dense, dark forest.

                                                                    

                WOODS - DAY

               A number of police cars parked in a clearing, the jumping 
               off place for a search party. Cooper, Truman, Hawk and Doc 
               Hayward. They're preparing to go off into the woods, when 
               Andy speeds up in his patrol car and gets out.

                                     ANDY
                              (excited)
                         Sheriff, Leo Johnson's been gone two 
                         days, his wife hasn't seen him--

                                     TRUMAN
                         Okay, Andy--

                                     ANDY
                         But the thing is, I looked into the 
                         kitchen? She was having breakfast 
                         and the table was set for two.

                                     COOPER
                         Good work, Andy. You keep those eyes 
                         peeled.

               Andy beams with pride.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Andy, I want you to stay with the 
                         cars.
                              (Andy's disappointed)
                         I need someone to stay near the radio. 
                         We'll keep in touch on the walkies.

               Andy nods and starts back to the cars.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hawk, lead the way.

               Hawk tunes up his sensory apparatus, nods, starts into the 
               woods. Cooper and Truman look at each other. Cooper nods.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Doc, you sure you're up for this?

                                     HAYWARD
                         In for a penny, in for a pound, Harry.

                                     TRUMAN
                         That's the spirit.

               They follow Hawk into the woods.

                                                               

                WOODS - DAY

               A dark, dark grove. The air still and moist. A solitary 
               mournful bird call. Hawk stops, listens, examines the ground, 
               finds something that leads him on. Cooper, Truman and Hayward 
               follow.

                                                                    

                LOG LADY'S CABIN - DAY

               Hawk turns a corner and comes upon a simple, solidly 
               constructed log cabin in a clearing. It is not the cabin we 
               saw in the photograph in Jacques' apartment. Smoke rises 
               from the chimney. The others join Hawk in the clearing.

                                     COOPER
                         Not the one we're looking for.

                                     HAWK
                         Maybe, maybe not.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You might want to hang back a step, 
                         Doc.

                                     HAYWARD
                              (winded)
                         Might want to anyway.

               As a precaution, Hawk and Truman draw weapons and along with 
               Cooper start to advance. As they round the corner of the 
               cabin, they come face to face with the LOG LADY, carrying a 
               log.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hello.

                                     LOG LADY
                         About time you got here.
                              (to herself)
                         They move so slowly when they're not 
                         afraid.

               She goes right inside the cabin. Pause. They look at each 
               other. The Log Lady appears in the doorway again.

                                     LOG LADY
                         Come on then. My log does not judge, 
                         it only records.

               She disappears again. They look at each other. Cooper nods. 
               Truman calls back.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Doc?

                                                                    

                LOG LADY'S CABIN - DAY

               Truman, Cooper, Hawk and then Doc enter. One large room. 
               Simple kitchen, a bed in the corner. Table with six chairs, 
               six places with a log-motif tea setting. A boarded up 
               fireplace. Fire extinguishers and a bucket of water in each 
               corner. An axe, a saw and other woodcutting tools. Framed 
               picture of a lumberjack, on the mantle, beside a funereal 
               urn, with ashes. Log Lady goes to the kitchen, where she's 
               preparing tea.

                                     LOG LADY
                         I've got tea. I've got cookies. No 
                         cake.

                                     COOPER
                         That's very kind of you, but I don't 
                         know if we have time to--

               Hawk signals him to accept the invitation, then takes the 
               lead and sits at the table.

                                     HAWK
                         What kind of cookies?

                                     LOG LADY
                         Sugar. The owls won't see us in here.

               Hayward sits at the table beside Hawk.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Some tea would be very nice.

                                     LOG LADY
                              (to Truman and Cooper, 
                              annoyed)
                         Shut your eyes and you will burst 
                         into flames.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Thank you.

                                     COOPER
                         Thank you very much.

               Truman and Cooper sit. The Log Lady sets down a plate of 
               cookies on the table, along with a log-motif tea pot, then 
               she takes a seat.

                                     LOG LADY
                         We'll let it steep.

               Pause. Cooper reaches for a cookie. Log Lady lightly slaps 
               his hand.

                                     LOG LADY
                         Wait for the tea. The fish aren't 
                         running.

               Cooper. looks around, noticing all the firefighting equipment. 
               She looks at him, as if to say, "Don't laugh. I see everything 
               and it takes it's toll." Pause.

                                     COOPER
                         Do you use fire for cooking then?

                                     LOG LADY
                         I go to great lengths to keep it 
                         under control.

                                     TRUMAN
                         M'am, were you expecting us?

                                     LOG LADY
                         You're two days late. Clues may be 
                         as cold as the tea but that's your 
                         concern.
                              (pause)
                         My log saw something, something 
                         significant. There's no closer 
                         relationship than the logger with 
                         the tree.

               Pause. Cooper looks at Truman.

                                     TRUMAN
                         M'am, what did your log see?

                                     LOG LADY
                              (shakes her head)
                         Drink first and be ready for the 
                         truth..

               She checks the pot, decides it's ready and starts to pour. 
               Six cups. Formal manners.

                                     COOPER
                              (passing the plate 
                              around)
                         Lime, Harry?

                                     LOG LADY
                         My husband was a logging man.

                                     COOPER
                         Oh?

                                     LOG LADY
                         He met the devil. The devil took the 
                         form of fire. Fire is the devil hiding 
                         like a coward in the smoke.

                                     HAYWARD
                              (he knows her)
                         The day after the wedding, wasn't it 
                         Margaret?

               She looks away.

                                     HAWK
                              (to the Log Lady, 
                              comforting)
                         The wood holds many spirits, doesn't 
                         it Margaret?

               She nods. Pause. They nibble on cookies and drink their tea. 
               The Log Lady turns to Cooper.

                                     LOG LADY
                         You can ask it now.

                                     COOPER
                              (to the log; solemnly, 
                              respectfully)
                         What did you see that night? The 
                         night Laura Palmer, was killed?

                                     LOG LADY
                              (pause to the log)
                         Shhhh. Let me do the talking.
                              (she closes her eyes; 
                              this is hard for her)
                         Dark. Laughing. The owls were flying. 
                         Many things were blocked. Laughing. 
                         Two men. Two girls. Flashlights, in 
                         the woods, pass by, over the ridge. 
                         The owls were near. The dark was 
                         pressing in on her...
                              (calmer)
                         Quiet then. A gentle wind. Footsteps, 
                         later, one man pass by. All quiet. 
                         Screams, far away. Terrible. Terrible. 
                         One voice...

                                     COOPER
                              (quietly)
                         Man or girl?

                                     LOG LADY
                         Girl... Further up. Over the ridge 
                         The owl were silent.

               She opens her eyes, blinks. Takes a sip of tea. Hayward dries 
               the tears in his eyes.

                                                                    

                WOODS DAY

               A light mist falls. Hawk, Truman, Cooper and Hayward make 
               their way up the ridge through thick woods.

                                     COOPER
                         The two girls are Laura and Ronette.

                                     TRUMAN
                         The two men Jacques, maybe Leo?

                                     COOPER
                         Maybe.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Who's the third man?

               Hawk stops suddenly, gestures them to be quiet. He listens.

                                     HAWK
                         Do you hear it?

               They listen... Far away... music. An angelic voice, soft 
               chords.

                                     HAWK
                         This way.

               They continue on.

                                                                    

                WOODS SECOND CABIN - DAY

               Hawk, Truman, Cooper and Hayward emerge from a thick stand 
               into a clearing; on a rocky point above them stands the log 
               cabin seen in the photo at Jacques; apartment. Rundown, not 
               well maintained. Red drapes are visible in a window. Cooper 
               looks at the photo. It was shot from the angle they're viewing 
               it from now.

               The music issues from inside the cabin. The song ends. Pause. 
               The same song begins again.

               Truman draws his weapon and takes the lead. Hawk and Cooper 
               draw their weapons and follow. Hayward sits on a rock and 
               wipes his brow with a handkerchief.

                                                                    

                SECOND CABIN - DAY

               The door creaks open, throwing the only light into the dark 
               room. Truman, Hawk and Cooper cautiously enter. The music is 
               louder. Cooper draws aside a set of the heavy, dusty red 
               drapes, letting more light into the room.

               On a simple record player, the tone arm pulled back over a 
               45 record, the song ends again, the stylus lifts, returns to 
               the outside, then back onto the outside edge of the record. 
               Scratches, pops, then the song starts again.

                                     COOPER
                              (under his breath)
                         ...and there's always music in the 
                         air..."

               Cooper lifts the stylus off the record. All three men proceed 
               with extreme care, trying not to move or disturb anything.

               The single room is dusty, trashy, a low-rent version of a 
               harem room: an overstuffed davenport, cheap oriental throw 
               rugs, tasseled satin pillows, empty bottles and full ashtrays.

               On a tripod, a 35 millimeter camera, facing a small photo 
               bay created by the drapes and pillows. Hawk checks it out.

                                     HAWK
                         There's film in here.

               Hawk takes out an evidence bag, removes the film.

               Cooper finds a spool of twine lying on the floor

               Another tripod shaped object, covered with a cloth. Truman 
               slowly draws the cloth off... a mynah bird in the cage reacts 
               drowsily, weak from hunger and thirst. A nameplate on the 
               cage reads... "O"

               Hawk draws their attention to dark stains on the wood and 
               one of the throw rugs. He examines it.

                                     HAWK
                         Blood.

               Cooper moves to look at it.

               Truman, backing up from the cage, hits a rocking chair which 
               rocks forward and hits a table, knocking over a lamp...

               Hawk, looking past Cooper, sees the lamp...

                                     HAWK
                         Watch out.

               Cooper avoids the lamp as it crashes to the floor. Something 
               skitters off the lamp and rolls under the davenport Hawk and 
               Cooper look at each other. Cooper reaches in under the 
               davenport, feels around, finds something. He pulls it out

                                                                  :

               POKER CHIP

               A thousand dollar chip, with a small chunk missing. It reads: 
               "ONE-EYED (J)ACK'S"

               Cooper and Hawk look at each other.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

                GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL BANQUET ROOM NIGHT

               A banner reads:

                 "FROM ICELAND TO TWIN PEAKS: A GREAT NORTHERN WELCOME!!"

               Festive, folksy Icelandic music, plays over the sound system. 
               The reception party is just under way. CITIZENS mingle with 
               the Icelanders, who cluster around the L-shaped buffet. The 
               Horne brothers mingle prominently. At the piano, Trudy leads 
               a group of Icelanders in an Icelandic version of Home on the 
               Range."

                                                                    

                BANQUET ROOM ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               Script above the door reads, "TIMBER ROOM." A HOTEL EMPLOYEE 
               is at the door, checking a guest list as people arrive. PETE 
               and CATHERINE MARTELL reach the door.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Catherine Martell and spouse.

               They're checked off the list and enter. We follow them.

                                     PETE
                         Go easy on the sauce tonight, okay 
                         Cathy?

               She stops a passing WAITER with a tray of champagne. Takes 
               two glasses. Slugs one down.

                                     CATHERINE
                         A few belts and even you might start 
                         to look good to me.

               She knocks back the second one, replaces the glasses on the 
               Waiter's tray, takes another glass and moves off, leaving 
               Pete.

                                                                    

               MAJOR BRIGGS AND EINER THORSON

               The Officer chats up the head Icelander, while they graze 
               from the buffet.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         --of course the modern age has changed 
                         forever the way your people live, 
                         Mr. Thorson, but my guess would be 
                         that there still remains a tremendous 
                         vestigial interest in the legends 
                         and folklore of ancient Iceland.

                                     EINER
                              (smiles, doesn't have 
                              a clue)
                         Vestigial. Absolutely.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         I know, speaking for myself, that I 
                         find these last remnants of a 
                         connection to a natural, more 
                         primitive, almost pagan way of life, 
                         endlessly fascinating; locally, for 
                         instance, we have the Sasquatch 
                         mythos, or Bigfoot, a large, evil 
                         smelling forest-dweller, which I 
                         suppose would correspond to your 
                         "huldufolk" or hidden people.

                                     EINER
                         Trolls?

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         Exactly.
                              (confidentially)
                         I also happen to be a firm believer 
                         in the UFO. I've seen some high-level 
                         classified data that would curl your 
                         hair.

                                                                    

               JERRY HORNE

               Jerry is all agog with the new object of his affection, the 
               tall and beautiful Icelandic girl, HEBA THORSDOTTIR, who's 
               playing with him.

                                     JERRY
                         Heba. Take a bite of that salmon 
                         tartare.
                              (he feeds her)
                         Did you know that was an American 
                         figure of speech?

                                     HEBA
                         No, Jerry.

                                     JERRY
                         "Heba-heba."  You've never heard 
                         that before?

                                     HEBA
                         No, Jerry.

                                     JERRY
                         Do you realize the incredible 
                         potential that could result from our 
                         taking a mutual dip into each other's 
                         respective gene pools?
                              (she doesn't understand 
                              the words, but she 
                              gets his meaning; 
                              they flirt)
                         Heba...
                              (almost a declaration 
                              of love)
                         ...I am going to cook for you.

                                                                    

               CATHERINE MARTELL

               Snaring another drink, she spots Benjamin Home chatting up 
               some Icelanders two clusters away, makes her way to him. She 
               clears her throat, trying to get his attention. He chats on. 
               She does it again. No luck. She deliberately spills her drink 
               on his shoe.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Oh.

                                     BEN
                         Excuse me, gentlemen.

               He takes her by the arm and steers her away. Quiet and angry.

                                     BEN
                         My office, give me two minutes to 
                         break away.

                                     CATHERINE
                              (stops, looks at him; 
                              a threat)
                         "Hell hath no fury..."

                                     BEN
                         What?
                              (he sees her look)
                         Two minutes.

               He moves off. She grabs another drink and heads for an exit. 
               She passes Audrey, who's semi-hiding behind a large wooden 
               column, watching the party with bright, disturbed eyes. 
               Moments later, she watches Ben leave by the same exit. She 
               follows him.

                                                                    

                TIMBER ROOM ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               JOSIE PACKARD enters the room, looks around, a little lonely 
               and out of place. She moves to Pete, who's piling up a massive 
               plate of food at the buffet.

                                     JOSIE
                         Hello, Pete.

                                     PETE
                         Hey, Josie, quite a spread they laid 
                         out, grab yourself some grub.

                                     JOSIE
                              (taking a plate, 
                              looking around)
                         So these are the Icemen?

                                     PETE
                         Somethin' like that.

                                                                    

               LELAND PALMER

               At the entrance, Leland Palmer shuffles into the room. He's 
               pale, clean shaven but sporting a large piece of tissue paper 
               stuck to a shaving mishap on his jaw line. He looks shakily 
               around, wanting very badly to fit in.

                                                                    

                HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Alone in the hallway, Audrey stops at a small secret door, 
               opens it.

                                                                    

                HOTEL WIRING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Audrey moves a short distance down the corridor in dim light, 
               kneels and slides a cover off a drilled peephole and looks 
               into...

                                                                  :

               AUDREY'S POV -  BEN HORNE'S OFFICE

               Catherine pours a drink at the bar, Ben takes the decanter 
               of Scotch from her, pops the top in.

                                     BEN
                         You're impossible.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Tell me again, Ben, tell me what 
                         you're going to do

                                     BEN
                         Speak English.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Tell me how you're going to drive 
                         the mill into the ground, grind that 
                         little Chinese flower to a fine dust, 
                         regain control of my brother's land, 
                         leave your wife and marry me.

               Audrey reacts.

                                     BEN
                         And they all lived happily ever after.

                                     CATHERINE
                              (pleasantly)
                         Look into my eyes, Ben. Do I look 
                         blind to you?

                                     BEN
                         Excuse me?

                                     CATHERINE
                              (still pleasant, takes 
                              out the chip)
                         Why did you have this thousand dollar 
                         poker chip from you know where in 
                         your pants yesterday?

               Ben looks at it, knows he's nailed. Straight-faced.

                                     BEN
                         Jerry gave that to me.

               She slaps him. He calmly pours himself a drink.

                                     BEN
                         It's a good luck charm that I thought 
                         I'd lost. I'm so relieved you've 
                         found it.

               She slaps him again. He sighs.

                                     BEN
                         Are you quite finished?

               She slaps him again. Satisfied, a bit hot.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Yes.

               She hands him the chip. He grabs her and kisses her hard.

               Audrey is laughing so hard she has to cover her mouth and 
               turn away from the peephole.

                                                                    

               BEN AND CATHERINE

                                     BEN
                              (breaking off, 
                              breathless)
                         Not here.

                                     CATHERINE
                              (whispers)
                         Let's burn the mill, let's do it, 
                         tonight.

                                     BEN
                         We'll just slip away from the party 
                         and hope no one detects the smell of 
                         kerosene upon return, no, my love, 
                         we'll give Josie one last chance to 
                         sell.

                                     CATHERINE
                         You'll talk to her.

                                     BEN
                         Tonight. Failing that, I've retained 
                         the services of a qualified 
                         professional.
                              (takes one, offers 
                              one to her)
                         Breath mint?

                                                                    

                HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Audrey comes out the same small door, closes it behind her. 
               She staggers along the corridor, letting out her laughter, 
               big bursts, hysterical and gilded with an edge of desperation 
               and madness.

                                                                    

                KING SALMON ROOM - NIGHT

               Pete stands next to Einer Thorson, the head Icelander, both 
               holding plates of food.

                                     PETE
                         Now let me get this straight; your 
                         entire country is above the timber 
                         line?

               His mouth full of food, Einer nods.

                                     JERRY HORNE'S VOICE
                              (amplified)
                         Folks, ladies and gentlemen, can I 
                         have your attention please?

                                                                    

               JERRY HORNE

               On a one-step riser at the end of the room, at a microphone.

                                     JERRY
                         Can I have your attention please?

               As the crowd congregates towards that side of the room.

                                     JERRY
                         First off, I want to thank you all 
                         for turning out tonight to welcome 
                         our neighbors from the magical island 
                         of Iceland. The Ghostwood Estates 
                         project is an important part of our 
                         future here in Twin Peaks, and there's 
                         no group we'd rather have as a partner 
                         in our future than--

               He's drowned out by the blaring sound of big band music from 
               the speakers.

                                                                    

               LELAND PALMER

               In the middle of the dance floor, he starts to go, a solitary 
               jitterbug. People clear out around him.

                                                                    

               BEN AND CATHERINE

               Re-entering the room. Ben exchanges a look with Jerry, who's 
               panicking. Ben whispers to Catherine.

                                     BEN
                         Dance with him.
                              (she gives him a look)
                         This is serious.

               Catherine moves out towards Leland.

                                                                    

               LELAND AND CATHERINE

               He slickly incorporates her into his dance and they commence 
               to cut a pretty mean rug. Leland is pouring down tears and 
               making little moaning sounds, but the crowd, happily clapping 
               along and half-soused, doesn't pick up those details.

                                                                  :

               BEN AND JERRY.

               Ben makes his way to his brother.

                                     BEN
                         Get Jacoby, get a net, get him out 
                         of my life.

               Jerry nods and moves off. Before he can get very far, he's 
               pulled out onto the floor by Heba and they begin to jitterbug.

                                                                    

               DANCE FLOOR - HIGH ANGLE

               The Icelanders love this new dance craze and spill onto the 
               floor, doing their best to duplicate Leland's style...

                                                                    

               LELAND AND CATHERINE

               Leland picks up his pace. Catherine realizes she's dancing 
               with a man teetering on the edge of a meltdown.

                                                                    

               AUDREY

               Watching from behind a post, away from the dance floor. She's 
               crying.

                                                                    

                PALMER HOUSE - NIGHT

               Establish.

                                                                    

                PALMER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Darkness. Madeleine creeps into the room, wearing a nightgown, 
               carrying a shoe box. A floorboard creaks. She gives a look 
               back upstairs, turns on a lamp, sits, picks up a phone and 
               quietly dials a number. Waits. Whispers.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Donna? It's Maddy... I was looking 
                         in Laura's closet and I couldn't 
                         find anything but I looked up and 
                         noticed there was a loose ceiling 
                         panel?... yes, that was her hiding 
                         place, I pushed the panel back, there 
                         was a shoe box up there...

               She takes off the cover of the box.

                                                                  :

               THE SHOE BOX

               We see four audio cassette tape cases inside. On the top 
               case we can read: "To Dr. Jacoby." There's a noise from 
               upstairs that startles her.

                                     MADELEINE
                         I'll meet you and James tomorrow. 
                         Bring a tape recorder.

               She hangs up, turns off the lamp, puts the cover back on the 
               shoe box and goes back out of the room.

                                                                    

                BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Darkness. Sounds of the party continue elsewhere. As our 
               eyes become accustomed to the darkness, we see someone sitting 
               at Ben's desk and the red glow of a cigarette as they inhale.

               The door opens. Ben enters the room. Josie turns on the lamp 
               at the desk where she's seated. Ben crosses to the desk.

                                     BEN
                         Did anyone see you come in here?

                                     JOSIE
                         No.

                                     BEN
                         You do realize the risk if anyone 
                         sees us.

                                     JOSIE
                         Yes.

               He sits on the edge of the desk. Josie puts out her cigarette.

                                     JOSIE
                         How much longer, Benjamin?

                                     BEN
                         Tomorrow night.

               They look at each other. She slowly extends her hand. He 
               takes her hand and kisses it tenderly. They look at each 
               other.

                                                                    

                LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               LEO JOHNSON pulls up in a beat-up pick-up truck with a covered 
               pay-load, stops beside a small shed outside his half-finished 
               garage. He gets out, looks around, unlocks the shack and 
               starts to load full gas-cans into the back of the truck.

                                                                  :

                JOHNSON'S HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

               A single, small lamp. Shelly, in robe and nightgown, moves 
               into the kitchen, looks out the window at Leo (off-screen). 
               Takes the gun from the table, puts it in her pocket, lights 
               a cigarette.

                                                                    

               LEO

               Secures the tarp back over the gas cans and moves towards 
               the house when he's slugged from behind in the kidneys. He 
               grunts and goes down on one knee.

               A SHADOWY ASSAILANT efficiently, silently and systematically 
               dismantles him, finally turning him and hitting him with 
               three hard right hands to the face. Dazed and bleeding, Leo 
               never knew what hit him. The Assailant grabs Leo by the lapels 
               and pulls him close. The Assailant is Hank Jennings.

                                     HANK
                         You were supposed to mind the store 
                         while I was gone, not open your own 
                         franchise--

                                     LEO
                         Hank--

               A short punch, then...

                                     HANK
                         Do as you're told, Leo. Next time 
                         you'll watch me take your little 
                         chippie apart before I kill you.

               Hank lets him go and disappears.

                JOHNSON KITCHEN - NIGHT

                                                                    

               Shelly, who hasn't heard a thing, finishes her cigarette. 
               Suddenly, Leo bursts in the door behind her, staggering to 
               the sink. turns on the water, his face a bloody mess...

                                     LEO
                         Shelly, call a doctor--

                                     SHELLY
                         Leo, what happened? You all right?

                                     LEO
                              (lashing out)
                         Just call the damn doctor, do as 
                         you're told!

               He backhands her, sends her sprawling. She lands hard. Takes 
               the gun from her pocket.

                                     LEO
                         What are you sitting around for? I 
                         said--
                              (sees the gun)
                         What the hell are you doin' with 
                         that?

                                     SHELLY
                              (taking out the gun)
                         Don't touch me, Leo, don't come near 
                         me--

                                     LEO
                              (laughing)
                         What are you gonna do, Shelly, shoot 
                         me?

                                     SHELLY
                         You're not gonna hurt me again--

                                     LEO
                              (bile seeping above 
                              the pain)
                         You stupid little slut, you don't 
                         even know how to use one--
                              (he advances on her)
                         Besides, you haven't got the guts--

               Shelly closes her eyes and fires. Leo yells, falls back, 
               knocking the lamp off the table. Darkness. Screaming. The 
               front door slams open and shut, the screaming moves outside.

               Shelly huddles in a corner, clutching the gun, terrified. We 
               hear the pick-up truck start and drive off. Shelly tries to 
               catch her breath.

                                                                    

                GREAT NORTHERN CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Dale Cooper rounds the corner, takes out his room key. He 
               stops, listens to the sounds of the still raucous Icelandic 
               party going on downstairs. Cooper sadly shakes his head, 
               starts to unlock his door and realizes it's open. He draws 
               his gun.

                                                                    

                COOPER'S ROOM - NIGHT

               The door stands open, light coming in from the corridor. 
               Cooper enters a moment later, with his weapon drawn. He slowly 
               closes the door, moves in, keeping the gun trained on the 
               bed.

                                     COOPER
                         Reach over slowly and turn on the 
                         bedside lamp.

               There's someone in the bed. The person turns on the lamp. 
               Audrey. Naked under the sheets, eyes red with tears.

                                     AUDREY
                         Don't make me leave. Please don't 
                         make me leave.

               Cooper slowly lowers his weapon.

ACT ONE
FADE IN:
1.  GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - DAY
Morning. CAMERA MOVES slowly through the dining room, a walking POV. AGENT
COOPER and ALBERT ROSENFIELD sit at a table up ahead.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals this to be the POV of the ASIAN MAN. He continues,
allows a waitress to seat him.

2.  GREAT NORTHERN CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Cooper and Albert sit at the table arrayed with breakfast foods. Griddlecakes, orange
juice, coffee. Cooper eats, expounds. Albert listens.
COOPER
Buddhist tradition reached the Land of Snow in the fifth
century A.D. The first Tibetan king to be touched by the
Dharma was Ha-tho-tho-ri gnyan-btsan. He, and all
succeeding kings were known collectively as the Happy
Generations. Some histories place the King in the water
snake year of 213 A.D. Others in 173 A.D. A water-ox
year. Amazing, isn't it? The Happy Generations.
Cooper takes a sip of hot coffee, beams. Albert, deadpan, just stares for a very long beat.
Then, finally:
ALBERT
Agent Cooper. I'm thrilled to pieces that the Dharma
came to King Ho-Ho and the Land of Schmoes. I really
am. But right now I'm trying hard to focus on the more
immediate problems of our own century. Right here in
Twin Peaks.
COOPER
(without malice)
You'd be surprised by the connections between the two.
ALBERT
Color me amazed.
COOPER
(on to business)
Ronette Pulaski has come out of her coma.
ALBERT
And?

2. CONTINUED:
COOPER
I'm thinking Ronette has quite a story to tell, once she
regains her ability to speak.
ALBERT
She's not talking.
COOPER
Wakened, but silent. Probably shock.
Cooper pulls two police sketches out of his briefcase. Leo Johnson. And Bob, the longhaired man.
COOPER
(continued)
I intend to show her these.
(re appropriate sketch)
Leo Johnson. And Bob - the man Sarah Palmer saw in her
vision. The man who came to me in my dream.
ALBERT
(the usual sour sarcasm)
Has anyone seen 'Bob' on Earth in the last few weeks?
COOPER
Not yet.
Cooper takes a big bite of griddlecake. Albert produces a report, speaks while referring to
it:
ALBERT
Fine. I performed the autopsy on Jacques Renault.
Contents of the deceased's stomach revealed beer cans, a
Maryland license plate, half a bicycle tire, a goat, and a
small wooden puppet. Goes by the name of Pinocchio.
COOPER
(delighted)
You're making a joke.
ALBERT
(deadpan)
I like to think of myself as one of the Happy Generations.
(back to report)
The killer snuffed the fat with a pillow. He was
Wearing gloves. Tape used to bind his wrists was stolen
from hospital supply closet. That's all. If Jacques has any
secrets he'll be taking them underground.

COOPER
The mill?
ALBERT
Preliminaries suggest arson. I nominate Leo Johnson.
COOPER
We need a statement from Shelly Johnson.
ALBERT
Hospital says she's well enough.
(beat)
How do you feel?
COOPER
Me?
ALBERT
I believe it's customary to inquire after the health of one
recently plugged with a thirty-eight. Three times.
COOPER
(almost touched)
Thanks for asking.
ALBERT
Don't get sentimental.
COOPER
(back to business)
Who shot me, Albert?
ALBERT
My men are interrogating hotel guests. The usual bumper
crop of rural know-nothings and drunken fly fishermen.
No leads so far. The world's most decrepit room service
waiter remembers nothing out-of-the-ordinary about the
night in question. No surprise there. Senor Drool Cup
has, shall we say, a mind that wanders. He -
The waitress interrupts, delivers a check. Cooper holds out a hand, signals he'll pay for it.
As Cooper signs his name and room:

COOPER
I appreciate your coming, Albert. We need the very best.
ALBERT
(confessing)
Dedication to duty isn't exactly what brought me here,
Cooper.
COOPER
What is?
ALBERT
Windom Earle.
Cooper reacts with surprise. Muted trepidation.
COOPER
Agent Earle. He retired.
ALBERT
To a comfortable chair complete with wrist restraints at
the local laughing academy.
COOPER
What happened?
ALBERT
Nobody knows. Your former partner flew the coop,
Coop. Into thin air.
COOPER
(quietly)
That's not good ...
HOLD ON Cooper for a beat.

3.  GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - DAY
Across the room, someone is watching. It is the Asian Man. He looks long at Agent
Cooper.

4.  HOSPITAL - DAY
Establish.

#2.002
5.
4.  RONETTE PULASKI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
RONETTE PULASKI gazes at the ceiling with blank expression. ANOTHER ANGLE
reveals Cooper and Truman at her bedside. A NURSE in the background. Cooper peers at
the girl, then:
COOPER
Ronette?
The eyes move, nothing else, to acknowledge them.
Cooper produces the two police sketches, prepatory to showing them to her.
COOPER
Ronette, I'm going to show you some pictures. I want
you to tell me if you have seen these men before. I want
to know if they are the men that hurt you.
His words spark a memory, the memory brings pain. All in her dark eyes. Cooper holds
the sketch of Leo Johnson toward her.
COOPER
Do you recognize this man?
A long beat. Then a surprise. Ronette's arm lifts into the air, as if separate from the rest of
her body. Cooper and Truman react. Ronette gingerly takes the sketch from Cooper, brings
it closer to her eyes. As if to better view it. Cooper wonders:
COOPER
(gently)
Can you see, Ronette?
Ronnette nods, almost imperceptibly. She stares at the sketch for a long, long beat.
TRUMAN
Do you know him?
A long beat. Ronette proceeds slowly, as though underwater. Finally she nods. Yes.
COOPER
Is this the man that hurt you?
Another beat. Then, finally ... she shakes her head. No.
(CONTINUED)
#2.002
6.
CONTINUED:
TRUMAN
(confirming)
No.
Cooper takes the sketch from Ronette, holds out the second picture. The long-haired man
named Bob. Again, Ronette reaches for it, brings the sketch toward her face. Near-sighted,
this is the only way she can clearly see it.
SUDDENLY Ronette's entire body seems to seize, her eyes dart about wildly.
COOPER
Ronette.
Ronette drops the sketch, her hand now knifes through the air, jagged motions, up and
down, to the side, and up and down. The nurse hurries forward to aid or restrain. But
Cooper intervenes.
COOPER
(to Nurse)
Wait.
(to Truman)
She's trying to spell something. Paper.
Truman produces paper and pen, hands them to the girl. Ronette clutches the pen, begins to
scrawl.
COOPER
Ronette. Is this the man that hurt you?
Ronette nods furiously as she writes, tears stream down her checks. She finishes, holds the
paper toward them. Cooper takes it. They read.
ANGLE ON PAPER
Ronette's fearful scrawl. TRAIN. LAURA. TRAIN.
BACK TO SCENE
TRUMAN
The train car.
But Cooper's not listening. He's staring at the sketch of Bob. The hard features. The long
flowing hair. Meanwhile, Ronnette begins to moan. Softly at first. Then building to a
terrified scream.
HOLD ON this tableau. Ronette upon the hospital bed. Cooper, Truman, and the nurse
hovering about her.

6:  ONE-EYED JACK'S - DAY
Establish.

7:  ONE-EYED JACK'S - DAY
The Get Acquainted Room. Early morning ease pervades. Girls lounge in robes, smoke
cigarettes. Two blondes play checkers in a corner. A third girl, NANCY, the Pickup seen
previously in Audrey's room, [sits and reads the morning paper.]
AUDREY HORNE passes through the morning, looking for clues. She sits next to Nancy.
AUDREY
Morning.
NANCY
You say that as if it's news.
Audrey lights up, ignores the rebuff, gestures toward the newspaper.
AUDREY
Well, what is news?
NANCY
Cookout at the Packard Mill.
Audrey peers at the banner headline: MILL BURNS. She reacts with unbridled delight.
AUDREY
Wow.
NANCY
Arson maybe.
AUDREY
(knowing)
I'll bet. Nancy, do me a favor?
(off girl's look)
I'm lookin' for somebody.
Audrey produces a photograph torn from a high school yearbook. Ronette Pulaski.
AUDREY
We worked Spokane together. Shriners and stuff.
NANCY
Ronette.

AUDREY
(alert)
You know her?
NANCY
Sorta. Just a summer girl. She didn't stay long.
AUDREY
(digging deeper)
Ronette had a friend. Laura. Ever see them together?
Suddenly: a male voice. It's EMORY BATTIS. Battis enters the Get-Acquainted Room,
pauses to greet familiar faces.
Audrey tamps out her cigarette, looks for exit.
AUDREY
Got to go. Maybe we can talk sometime.
With that, Audrey, rises, steps away. Nancy looks up from her paper, watches her leave.
There's a cold look in her eyes.
READING GIRL
Anything you say, 'Miss Horne.'
Busted. Nancy turns her gaze toward Battis by the door.

8.  APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY
DONNA HAYWARD stands at the door, carrying a covered meal tray. She checks a piece
of paper, doublechecks the address. And knocks.
DONNA
Hello? Mrs. Tremond? Meals On Wheels.
A long beat. Donna's about to step away. Then a voice from within:
VOICE
Enter.
Donna hesitates, tries the door. It's open. She hefts the tray, steps inside.

9.  TREMOND APARTMENT - DAY
A shadowy interior. Pill bottles of every size and description on litter the room. An old
woman, MRS. TREMOND, reclines in bed. A SMALL BOY stands before her. He wears
a dark suit. The boy's hands move gracefully through the air, perform a magic card trick.

The old woman expectorates quietly into a handkerchief. She mutters.
TREMOND
Again.
The little boy repeats the magic trick. The old woman spits into the handkerchief, mutters.
It's as if Donna was invisible.
DONNA
Mrs. Tremond?
The old woman gestures toward a coffee table, more pill bottles, nearby.
TREMOND
Please.
Donna sets the tray upon the table, removes its cover. Reveals the meal beneath. The old
woman shifts, peers down at the hot food.
TREMOND
Cream corn. "I requested no cream corn.
DONNA
Sorry.
TREMOND
We detest yellow food.
DONNA
Next time, I'll...
As they speak, the little boy carries the tray to the old woman, arranges silverware. A
playing card slips into view, settles amidst warm chicken and rice.
TREMOND
My niece is a nurse. Sent me hospital food. Can you
imagine?
DONNA
Uhm, no.
TREMOND
Tastes like paste. I ordered Meals On Wheels myself.
Laura Palmer brought them to me. She's dead.
DONNA
I'm taking over Laura's route.

DONNA
Did you know her well?
TREMOND
No.
The old woman's reply is abrupt, final. She does not desire further conversation. Donna
sighs. She will learn nothing here.
DONNA
Enjoy your meal. I'll remember the corn.
Donna steps toward the door. Suddenly:
TREMOND
Young lady.
(off her look)
You might ask Mr. Smith next door. He was Laura's
friend. Mr. Smith does not leave his room.
DONNA
Thank you.
The little boy steps to Donna's side. He produces a red rose, sleight of hand, and offers it to
her. Donna smiles.

10.  APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY
Donna stands before apartment number 3, knocks. But no one answers. She scribbles a note,
slides it under the door.
Donna steps back to her car. Behind her, hands gently part pale curtains. Someone watches
her leaving.

11.  BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
BEN HORNE sits at his desk, a mill ledger spread out before him. JERRY HORNE
bounds about, nibbling on a block of cheese. Flames leap in the office fireplace.
Ben barks an order into the phone.
BEN
Tell Mrs. Horne I'm in a meeting.
(CONTINUED)
#2.002
CONTINUED:
Jerry pauses in front of Ben's desk. Gestures. As if to make a formal presentation.
JERRY
Ben, I'm struggling for understanding. Evidence to be
examined. Two mill ledgers.
BEN
One fake, one real.
JERRY
The real?
BEN
Josie was running a loser.
JERRY
The fake?
BEN
Catherine was covering it up.
JERRY
Criminally.
BEN
To our advantage. With our consent.
JERRY
Which brings us to Andrew Packard's will.
BEN
The ledger gambit guarantees the mill goes bankrupt, the
will gives Catherine the mill. Catherine sells to us and
pockets the cash.
The intercom buzzes, intrudes. Ben sighs, picks up the phone.
BEN
(into phone)
Now whit?! Tell her I'm still in a meeting.
Ben slams down the phone.
JERRY
So you promised Catherine the moon. Catherine eats
cheese instead.
Jerry offers Ben a bite from the block he's holding. Ben shakes it off, replies:

CONTINUED: (2)
BEN
Josie is a more than pliable business partner.
JERRY
Query: How pliable?
BEN
She gets the cash. We get the mill. And the land for
Ghostwood.
JERRY
I wonder ... what does Josie really want?
BEN
(puzzled)
I don't know. You?
JERRY
Stumped.
BEN
(using Jerry's lingo)
Eternal Query: What do women want?
JERRY
Doublestumped.
Jerry's pacing brings him back to the desk, the ledger spread out before him.
JERRY
(re ledger on desk)
So ... which ledger is this?
BEN
The fake.
JERRY
Bad news for Catherine.
BEN
May flights of angels guide her to her rest.
JERRY
Bad news for us then.
BEN
If it went public.

JERRY
Let's keep it private.
BEN
How private?
JERRY
Dust to dust...
BEN
Ashes to ashes.
Ben tosses the ledger to Jerry. Jerry tosses the ledger into the roaring fire. Both pause to
watch it burn.
Just then: a harried SECRETARY marches into the office.
BEN
I told you I'm in a meeting!
The secretary interrupts, holds out a note for his perusal.

11. CONTINUED:(4)
BEN

Mrs. Horne?
The secretary nods, exits. Ben opens the folded paper, reads. A beat.
JERRY
Good news?
BEN
No. Audrey appears to be missing.

FADE IN:
12.  BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
Establish. A Sheriff's cruiser parked out front.

13.  BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
Cooper, Truman, and Albert gather about PETE MARTELL at the dining room table.
Pete's dazed, a little singed around the edges.
PETE
She was afraid. I've never seen Catherine afraid before.
Well. When we went camping she killed a snake. And a
tree hit me one time. She had a reaction.
Albert rolls his eyes. But Cooper preempts him with a stern glance. Pete produces an
account ledger, places it on the table.
PETE
Catherine asked me to help her find the account ledger.
She asked me to help her.
(beat)
This was in her safe. Catherine said it was the wrong one.
TRUMAN
Josie showed me a second ledger.
ALBERT
(to Pete)
Sounds like your wife was cookin' the books.
PETE
We couldn't find it anywhere. But I found my high school
yearbook. Midge Jones.
(beat)
Midge had blue eyes like a robin's egg. And a funny way
of walking. One foot here, one foot there, one foot here,
one foot there.
ALBERT
(he can't help himself)
Feets don't fail me now.

Pete? Let's make a heroic attempt to keep our minds, and
what's left of yours, trained on the night in question. The
night the mill burned down.

Pete looks up, seems to see Albert for the first time.
PETE
I don't like you.
COOPER

No one does, Pete.
TRUMAN
(muttered)
Amen to that.
ALBERT
Well bounce my butt out of the Glee Club. Gentlemen,
I've got a job to do.
COOPER
(to Pete)
Did Catherine tell you what was in the ledger?
PETE
Heavens no. But she was desperate to find it. Until the
phone rang and she was gone. I saw her car out front. The
mill was burning. So I went inside ...
Pete can't continue.
COOPER
I'm sorry, Pete. We all are.
PETE
Have you found ... her body?
Cooper shakes his head. No.
ALBERT
A mill fire burns somewhere close to two thousand
degrees, Mr. Martell. That's hot enough to incinerate
bone.
Cooper places a reproving hand on Albert's, stops him from continuing. Pete fixes Albert
with a baleful stare. A beat. Then, in a whisper:
PETE
Catherine's dead.
Pete sighs. Then stands, offers.

Pete shuffles off toward the kitchen. Cooper and Albert trade conclusions. Truman watches
quietly, as a spectator at a tennis match.
COOPER
Leo's clothing reeked of gasoline.
ALBERT
Gas cans found at the hot spot matched those in the back
of his truck.
COOPER
Catherine hired Leo to burn down the mill.
ALBERT
She gets a phone call. From Leo?
COOPER
Maybe something went wrong.
ALBERT
Wrong enough. Mill burns. Catherine with it.
COOPER
I want Shelly Johnson. She can put Leo at the scene.
Catherine too.

Meanwhile, Cooper and Albert continue. Truman spectates as before.
ALBERT
We need a look at Catherine Martell's will.
COOPER
Who stood to benefit from her death?
ALBERT
Who gets the mill? Or what's left of it.
COOPER
Life insurance.
ALBERT
I'll run the policy for beneficiaries.
Albert turns to Truman, sneers at his silence.
ALBERT
Don't be shy, Prince of Yokels. You too can participate in
the investigatory process.
Truman rises. Cooper grabs him by the arm. Just then: Pete interrupts.
PETE
(eyes on Albert)
Excuse me, boys. Coffee. Piping hot.
ALBERT
(muttered)
Morons and mooncalves, everywhere I go.
Pete carries a wooden tray into view. He speaks as he sets and pours coffee for four.
PETE
When I met Catherine, she was dating a fellow named
Rodney Pocquet. French-Canadian millionare's son.
Rich as Croesus. Rodney never said it, but he looked
down on me. I know he did. And why not? Rodney in
his fine summer suits. Me in my overalls and boots. I
never minded all that much.
(beat)
Until he started talking rude to me. Like I wasn't even
there. Rodney Pocquet hurt my feelings. He embarrassed
me in front of my friends. That made me mad.
Pete pauses, sets down the coffee pot. Albert wonders.

ALBERT
(with a sigh)
Is there a point to this insensate ramble?
PETE
Well, yes. There is. I hiked up to Rodney's big house.
And I socked him on the jaw. Rodney never talked that
way to me again.
Albert looks to Cooper and Truman. He knows what's coming.
ALBERT
Not again.
They nod. And Pete floors Albert with a slow right cross to the jaw.

16.  THE DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
OPEN ON a police flyer. The official sketch of the long-haired man named Bob. And a
headline. HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN as he carefully attaches the
flyer to the inside of the Double R Diner doors. Andy's using scotch tape to affix the paper
flyer. He's managed to get a piece caught in his tufted hair. LELAND PALMER and
MADDY FERGUSON enter past Andy and move to a booth. Leland is resplendent in
sharp suit, bright white hair, and a whole new attitude. He nearly beams.

NORMA JENNINGS approaches.
LELAND (CONTINUED)
Norma, two chocolate malteds, with a dollop of
whipped cream on the top.
NORMA
You're looking well, Mr. Palmer.
LELAND
I'm feeling well, thank you.
Norma moves back to the counter. Leland recounts a happy memory.
LELAND (CONTINUED)
Laura's favorite was a drink we used to call a Brown Cow.
It's like a root beer float only made with a cola drink
and vanilla ice cream. She had her first, with me, in that
booth right there.
MADDY
I'm glad you're feeling better, Uncle Leland.
LELAND
A man must take care of his family. And I still have a
family to take care of.
He reaches over, takes her hands. With pride.
LELAND (CONTINUED)
I'm coming through the pain, Maddy. I'm coming
through alive.

17.  DINER - DAY

Hank.
HANK
I look at you, and I feel a little tug at the edge of my
lips, right next to the kissing part. And before I know it,
I'm grinning again.
NORMA
(trying not to be charmed)
No sale; you're thirty minutes late.
HANK
Okay, you found me out.
Hank produces a poloroid, holds it up for Norma to examine.
HANK
A 1965 GTO. Convertible. One owner. Forty thousand
miles. Clean and cherry.
NORMA
For what?
HANK
For you. It's a surprise, honey. Well, it was.
NORMA
Where will we get the money? The diner's barely
breaking even.
HANK
I put a little money away for something special. Trust
me, okay?
NORMA
(lightly)
Trust you?
Hank pulls Norma a little closer, brings his hips as close as propriety allows. Norma
reacts, but she doesn't move away. Hank nearly whispers.

Norma sets down the malteds.
LELAND
Thank you, Norma. Now, Maddy, a little piece of
heaven.
They try their malteds.
MADDY
Incredible.
LELAND
What did I tell you? Just another routine miracle of
everyday life here in Twin Peaks.
MADDY
Uncle Leland, you're doing all the right things.
LELAND
What do you mean, dear?
MADDY
When Dad died two years ago, I thought I'd never get
over it. Mom never has. It was focusing on the little
things that got me through it. The "everyday miracles."
LELAND
Life is a miracle. Maddy, I want to say something to
you, you don't have to answer, in fact you shouldn't. You
should think about it first. Promise first.
MADDY
Okay.

course, but stay in town. We're family, too. We can
make a family here.
MADDY

I don't know what to say.

You shouldn't say anything until you eat that malted.
She smiles. They dig in.

21.  THE DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
MAJOR BRIGGS enters and sits at the counter, enjoys a cup of coffee, a little
contemplation. The LOG LADY appears, sits beside him. Holding, patting her log. She

LOG LADY
You wear bright objects on your chest.
MAJOR BRIGGS

Yes. I do.
LOG LADY
Are you proud?
MAJOR BRIGGS
Achievement is its own reward. Pride obscures it.
Cream?
The Log Lady nods. Major Briggs adds cream to her coffee. She sips.
LOG LADY
My log has something to tell you. Do you know him?
MAJOR BRIGGS
I don't believe we've been introduced.

Yes. As a matter of fact, I do.

23.  SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
Deputy Andy marches up to reception, LUCY MORAN behind the sliding glass. He pulls
it open with a forceful tug. But Lucy glares ...
LUCY
No messages, Deputy Brennen.
... and slams it shut. Undaunted, Deputy Andy throws the glass partition open a second time,
even more forcefully. Lucy reacts with surprise.
ANDY
Listen to me, Lucy Moran. You just listen.
(a piece of tape still stuck to his head)
When the Tacoma Sperm Bank was looking for donors,
naturally I applied. But a routine physical revealed that I
was sterile. Sure, I thought it meant I didn't have to
bathe, but the doctors told me the truth. They told me I
can't have babies. So what I want to know now is why are
you having one? And how?
Lucy looks up at Andy, her lips quivering slightly. Then she reaches forward, as if to caress
him. Andy reacts, leans closer ... and Lucy TEARS the scotch tape from his head, closes the
glass door one last time.

24.  SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Hank Jennings stands and stares at the stag's head mounted on the wall behind Sheriff
Truman's desk. There's a placard beneath it that reads: THE BUCK STOPPED HERE.
Suddenly, a voice behind him:

Hello, Hank.
Hank turns to find Sheriff Truman and Agent Cooper enter the office.
TRUMAN
I'm betting Lucy asked you to wait outside.
HANK
Might've. You know me, Harry. I'm an impulsive guy.
Truman sighs, circles to his desk. Retrieves the appropriate form.
TRUMAN
I know enough not to waste my time on small talk. So
why don't you sign in like a good boy, and keep your nose
clean for another week.
Hank stares at Harry for a long beat. There is bad blood between them. Then he signs
without a word, turns on his heels, and steps out the door. A beat, then:
COOPER
How long were you and Hank friends?
TRUMAN
We grew up together. Ed, Hawk, Hank, myself.
Bookhouse Boys. Back then Hank was the best of us.
But he had a way of setting his heart on something, then
taking it. No matter how much it cost him. One day he
set his heart on Norma. And he took her from Big Ed.
"Never cheat a pal." That was our code. Hank broke it.
An intercom beeper interrupts. Lucy's VOICE is heard:
LUCY'S VOICE
Sheriff Truman? I have Ben Home on the phone for you.
The line with the light that's blinking.
TRUMAN
Thank you, Lucy ... hello? Yes, Ben ... What? ... Right away.
Truman returns the phone to its cradle. He looks up at Cooper, speaks with quiet urgency:
TRUMAN
Audrey Horne is missing.

Harry escorts Ben out of his office.
BEN
I'd appreciate it if you would keep this quiet, Harry.
TRUMAN
I'll do what I can. But...
BEN
Audrey has a penchant for the dramatic. The unexplained
disappearance, is, after all, a part of her repetoire. And
with Laura's killer in custody, well, you understand. No
need to panic.
Harry knows different. But Ben's attitude irks him just the same.
TRUMAN
I understand, Ben. We'll be in touch.
Ben exits. Harry turns to find Cooper in the office doorway, watching with evident concern.

26.  HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
LEO JOHNSON stares at the ceiling. At the future, at the past, at nothing at all. His eyes
are blank and fathomless.
SHELLY JOHNSON stands with DOC HAYWARD at his bedside. She is dressed in
hospital garb. Shelly peers at Leo with fear, muted revulsion. His death was something to
be wished for. But this intermediate state is beyond Shelly's ability to understand.
HAYWARD
The bullet lodged in Leo's spine. We removed it
successfully. As for possible paralysis, it's too early to
tell. Leo lost so much blood, most of it before we had a
chance to' operate...

I'm afraid tile resulting oxygen deprivation starved his
brain, induced the coma you see here.
SHELLY
He's a vegetable?

HAYWARD

He is not in pain. Beyond that, it's hard to tell.
SHELLY
Can you make him better?
Shelly's tone suggests she's not exactly pining for cure.
HAYWARD
We can maintain his current state. Offer him
nourishment, life support. But beyond that, our only ally
is time. I'm sorry, Shelly.
SHELLY
Me too. Arc they going to put him in prison?
HAYWARD
I know he's suspected of several felonies. But he can't be
charged with a crime until he's conscious or ruled
competent to stand trial.
SHELLY
I guess, at the moment, he's kind of in prison anyway.
HAYWARD
Yes he is.
She starts to cry, softly. Doc puts a comforting arm around her.

Ben sits behind his desk. Jerry enters, tosses a document upon it.
JERRY
One life insurance policy. Unsigned.
BEN
'Un'?!
JERRY
The agent said Catherine was concerned about "certain
irregularities." Like naming Josie chief beneficiary.
BEN
The agent wasn't supposed to show it to her.
JERRY
Considering Catherine's toasty fate, for our side it's just
as well
BEN
(tossing policy in trash)
Win a few, lose a few ... let's get those pickled Icemen on
the blower.
Jerry starts to dial internationally. Ben picks up an extension. Just then: a cheery shout at the
door.
LELAND'S VOICE
Gentlemen!!
Ben looks up. Now what? Leland hops into the office, all smiles and manic energy.
LELAND
I've been giving this a lot of thought. The mill fire will
no doubt put contract signing on hold for the moment, so
we must insure that the moment, our moment, does not
pass. I would recommend a quick and cordialfollow-up
phonecall to Iceland, a little gentle handling, just to let
Einer know we're on top of it.

We can handle that.
Just then: the call comes through.
BEN
Ben Home for Einer Thorson - Einer! (Icelandic phrase)
What's that? You heard about it how? Mr. Palmer called
you to tell you about the fire?
Leland gives a big "ok" sign to Ben. Jerry rolls his eyes.
BEN (CONTINUED)
No, I wouldn't call it a disaster at all. It was just one of
those things. An unfortunate development but I assure you
it in no way affects our developmcnt plans.
JERRY
Jerry Horne here, Einer. All systems go. Full speed
ahead.
BEN
Of course, Einer. We will fax you all the pertinent
details. Yes, Einer, immediately. Don't you worry your
attractive little blond head about it, listen, in a meeting,
gotta run.
Ben puts down the receiver.
BEN

Leland, here's an idea, let's take you off damage control
and have you concentrate on something you can handle,
like my tax return -

But Leland's not listening. He stares at Ben's desk, the police flyer upon it. Bob the longhaired man. HAVE YOU SEEN ...?
LELAND
I know him.
BEN
Excuse me?
Leland picks up the flyer, stares at the sketch. His mood is suddenly quiet, pensive.
LELAND
My grandfather's summer home at Pearl Lakes. He lived
next door. I was only a boy. But I know him.
(beat)
I must tell the Sheriff immedidately.
Leland turns on his heels and marches out the door. A beat, then:

complicated. No big deal. just a little fun.

31.  ONE-EYED JACKS ROOM - NIGHT
Emory Battis sits in a comfortable armchair, feet up. He wears an Oriental robe, a Santa's
cap, and a silk scarf tied around his eyes. His toenails have been painted bright red, cotton
balls between them as they dry.
Battis hears the door open, chirps:
BATTIS
Frosty? My little Snowman?
Audrey enters, sets the bucket at his feet. Battis, blindfolded, grins.
BATTIS
I feel a cold front moving in.
Audrey slips behind him, places her hands over the blindfold. Then slowly unties the knot
behind his head.
BATTIS
Mmmm. Better. Visible sin.
Audrey lets the loosened scarf slip down about his chin. Then, before he can react - she pulls
it tightly about his neck.
BATTIS
Hey!
AUDREY
Hiya, Mr. Battis. Remember me?
The voice, a glimpse of her face, tell Battis all he needs to know. He nods.
AUDREY
I'm gonna tell you a bedtime story. Are you listening?
With that she tugs the scarf a little tighter.
BATTIS
Yes. Yes.
AUDREY
Once upon a time there was this innocent little girl
named Red. That's me. And she met a horrible wolf.
That's you. And the wolf took her to a secret place and
did terrible things to her against her will. But the little
girl was tougher than she looked. She kicked the crap out
of the bad old wolf, and told her father all about it.
After that she told the police. And the bad old wolf
went to prison for a thousand years.

As she speaks, Audrey twists the scarf tighter and tighter. Now she releases it. Battis gasps
for breath. At last:
BATTIS

AUDREY
I want to know everything you know. The perfume
counter. Laura Palmer. Ronette Pulaski. And One-Eyed
Jack's.
BATTIS
You're insane.
AUDREY
I'm Audrey Horne. And I get what I want. Understand?
Audrey moves as if to tighten the scarf again. Battis protests.
BATTIS
Yes. All right.
A long beat. Battis sighs. And begins:
BATTIS
I work for the owner of One-Eyed Jack's.
Audrey pulls on the scarf. Whenever Battis hesitates, is tempted to lie, she reins him in.
AUDREY
(she knows)
Who is?
BATTIS
Your father. He owns it all. Hell, he owns everything.
(beat)
I run girls through the perfume counter. I recruited
Ronnette and Laura.
AUDREY
Did Laura come here?
BATTIS
One weekend. She was using drugs, we threw her out. I
never saw her again. I swear.
AUDREY
Did my father know she was here?

BATTIS
I don't know. Yes. Yes, she probably did.
Audrey finally drops the scarf from his neck. The information - her father, Laura - troubles
her deeply. Scares her too. A beat. Then, quietly:
BATTIS

32  HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT
JAMES HURLEY sits on a couch in the living room, holds a guitar in his hands. Donnna sits
in a chair nearby, watches him play.
It's a slow blues riff, snakes and ladders up the fret board. James concentrates with typically
solemn expression, lost in the music. Then he looks up, sees Maddy return to the room with
a soda.
Maddy smiles, sways to the music. Then, slowly, she begins to dance. It's a sweet sudden
moment. Maddy dancing across the carpet, hips rolling side to side, her body keeping
time. James stares at Maddy. The sexy steps. The easy smile. It could almost be Laura
dancing there.
Donna sees it too. She frowns, steps quickly from the room.
DONNA
Excuse me.
James abruptly stops playing. Maddy dances a single beat after, then freezes. James follows
Donna toward the kitchen.

33  HAYWARD HOUSE CORRIDOR - NIGHT
James catches up to her in the hall. He takes Donna by the arm. Donna whirls violently
about to face him.
JAMES
Donna, what's going on?
DONNA
Nothing.
JAMES
Donna -
Donna interrupts with a passionate embrace. James resists at first. But Donna will not be
dissuaded. She bites at his lips, offers soft kisses, then hard. James relents. And their
embrace deepens, gives rise to whispered moans. And the fevered kiss continues.
Finally: James pulls away, quite breathless. He looks at Donna in the shadows, as if uncertain
who is standing there.

Donna reacts. Steps away.

James rushes to her side, takes Maddy into his arms. She's nearly in shock.

only get it if Leo stays at home.
SHELLY
I don't care about the money. I don't want Leo home.
BOBBY
Leo's in dreamland. We can stick him in a corner and
hang plants from his ears.
SHELLY
Sheriff Truman wants me to make a statement.
BOBBY
No way. Tell the Sheriff you got amnesia or something.
The fire twisted your brain.
SHELLY
I'm feeling pretty twisted right now.
BOBBY
They can't force you to testify against your husband. All
you got to do is get Leo home. Then sit back and collect
the checks.

Leo owes you, baby. Now we can really make him pay.
You want something nice? We can buy it. You wanna go
someplace special, sit in the sun? It's on Leo.
Understand?

It'd be nice not to worry about money. I got a shoebox

COOPER
Diane, I received bad news today. Windom Earle has
vanished. Audrey Home is missing. There is of course no
connection, except for the simple fact that my former
partner's disappearance seems to matter less to me than
that of a troublesome high school girl.

Mr. Home is convinced she has run away and will return.
I wish I shared his confidence. Though not his callous
indifference.
(beat)
An all-points bulletin, routine checks of the train car and
Jacques' cabin have revealed nothing. Not a trace of her.
Cooper shuts off the recorder. As if to wonder. Then he starts it again. Speaks more softly:
COOPER
Audrey's absence touches me in ways I did not predict. I
find myself thinking not of clues or evidence, but of the
content of her smile. The way it gives the lie to her
delinquent posing, the hardened exterior which I suspect
is more a matter of self-preservation than a heart that is
cold. Audrey's heart is warm.
Cooper flicks off the recorder. Sets it on his bedside table. just then: a knock at the door.
COOPER

standing there.
COOPER

BRIGGS
May I come in?
COOPER
Please.
Briggs enters, Cooper gestures toward the room's single chair. Briggs sits.
BRIGGS
I have a message for you.
COOPER
From whom?
BRIGGS
I am not at liberty to reveal the nature of my work. This
secrecy pains me from time to time. Any bureaucracy
that functions in secret inevitably lends itself to
corruption. But these are the rules I have pledged to
uphold. I believe a pledge is sacred.
COOPER
Speaking as both a man and a fellow employee of the
federal government so do I.
BRIGGS
I may reveal this much. Among my many tasks is the
maintenance of deep space monitors aimed at galaxies
beyond our own. We routinely receive various
communications, space garbage to decode and examine.
The results look something like this.
Briggs produces a paper readout, holds it out for Cooper to examine. The sheet is covered
with letters, numbers, signifying nothing.
BRIGGS
Radio waves and gibberish, Agent Cooper. Until Friday

Briggs holds out one last readout.

Morning. CAMERA MOVES slowly through the dining room, a walking POV. AGENT
COOPER and ALBERT ROSENFIELD sit at a table up ahead.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals this to be the POV of the ASIAN MAN. He continues,
allows a waitress to seat him.

Cooper and Albert sit at the table arrayed with breakfast foods. Griddlecakes, orange
juice, coffee. Cooper eats, expounds. Albert listens.
COOPER
Buddhist tradition reached the Land of Snow in the fifth
century A.D. The first Tibetan king to be touched by the
Dharma was Ha-tho-tho-ri gnyan-btsan. He, and all
succeeding kings were known collectively as the Happy
Generations. Some histories place the King in the water
snake year of 213 A.D. Others in 173 A.D. A water-ox
year. Amazing, isn't it? The Happy Generations.
Cooper takes a sip of hot coffee, beams. Albert, deadpan, just stares for a very long beat.
Then, finally:
ALBERT
Agent Cooper. I'm thrilled to pieces that the Dharma
came to King Ho-Ho and the Land of Schmoes. I really
am. But right now I'm trying hard to focus on the more
immediate problems of our own century. Right here in

ALBERT

Has anyone seen 'Bob' on Earth in the last few weeks?
COOPER
Not yet.
Cooper takes a big bite of griddlecake. Albert produces a report, speaks while referring to
it:
ALBERT
Fine. I performed the autopsy on Jacques Renault.
Contents of the deceased's stomach revealed beer cans, a
Maryland license plate, half a bicycle tire, a goat, and a
small wooden puppet. Goes by the name of Pinocchio.
COOPER

You're making a joke.
ALBERT

I like to think of myself as one of the Happy Generations.

My men are interrogating hotel guests. The usual bumper

No leads so far. The world's most decrepit room service

Ronette?
The eyes move, nothing else, to acknowledge them.
Cooper produces the two police sketches, prepatory to showing them to her.
COOPER
Ronette, I'm going to show you some pictures. I want
you to tell me if you have seen these men before. I want
to know if they are the men that hurt you.
His words spark a memory, the memory brings pain. All in her dark eyes. Cooper holds
the sketch of Leo Johnson toward her.
COOPER
Do you recognize this man?
A long beat. Then a surprise. Ronette's arm lifts into the air, as if separate from the rest of
her body. Cooper and Truman react. Ronette gingerly takes the sketch from Cooper, brings
it closer to her eyes. As if to better view it. Cooper wonders:
COOPER

Can you see, Ronette?
Ronnette nods, almost imperceptibly. She stares at the sketch for a long, long beat.
TRUMAN
Do you know him?
A long beat. Ronette proceeds slowly, as though underwater. Finally she nods. Yes.
COOPER
Is this the man that hurt you?
Another beat. Then, finally ... she shakes her head. No.

CONTINUED:
TRUMAN
(confirming)
No.
Cooper takes the sketch from Ronette, holds out the second picture. The long-haired man
named Bob. Again, Ronette reaches for it, brings the sketch toward her face. Near-sighted,
this is the only way she can clearly see it.
SUDDENLY Ronette's entire body seems to seize, her eyes dart about wildly.
COOPER
Ronette.
Ronette drops the sketch, her hand now knifes through the air, jagged motions, up and
down, to the side, and up and down. The nurse hurries forward to aid or restrain. But
Cooper intervenes.
COOPER
(to Nurse)
Wait.
(to Truman)
She's trying to spell something. Paper.
Truman produces paper and pen, hands them to the girl. Ronette clutches the pen, begins to
scrawl.
COOPER
Ronette. Is this the man that hurt you?
Ronette nods furiously as she writes, tears stream down her checks. She finishes, holds the
paper toward them. Cooper takes it. They read.
ANGLE ON PAPER
Ronette's fearful scrawl. TRAIN. LAURA. TRAIN.
BACK TO SCENE
TRUMAN
The train car.
But Cooper's not listening. He's staring at the sketch of Bob. The hard features. The long
flowing hair. Meanwhile, Ronnette begins to moan. Softly at first. Then building to a
terrified scream.
HOLD ON this tableau. Ronette upon the hospital bed. Cooper, Truman, and the nurse
hovering about her.

7:  ONE-EYED JACK'S - DAY
The Get Acquainted Room. Early morning ease pervades. Girls lounge in robes, smoke
cigarettes. Two blondes play checkers in a corner. A third girl, NANCY, the Pickup seen
previously in Audrey's room, [sits and reads the morning paper.]
AUDREY HORNE passes through the morning, looking for clues. She sits next to Nancy.
AUDREY
Morning.
NANCY
You say that as if it's news.
Audrey lights up, ignores the rebuff, gestures toward the newspaper.
AUDREY
Well, what is news?
NANCY
Cookout at the Packard Mill.
Audrey peers at the banner headline: MILL BURNS. She reacts with unbridled delight.
AUDREY
Wow.
NANCY
Arson maybe.
AUDREY
(knowing)
I'll bet. Nancy, do me a favor?
(off girl's look)
I'm lookin' for somebody.
Audrey produces a photograph torn from a high school yearbook. Ronette Pulaski.

AUDREY

Ronette had a friend. Laura. Ever see them together?
Suddenly: a male voice. It's EMORY BATTIS. Battis enters the Get-Acquainted Room,
pauses to greet familiar faces.
Audrey tamps out her cigarette, looks for exit.
AUDREY
Got to go. Maybe we can talk sometime.
With that, Audrey, rises, steps away. Nancy looks up from her paper, watches her leave.
There's a cold look in her eyes.
READING GIRL
Anything you say, 'Miss Horne.'
Busted. Nancy turns her gaze toward Battis by the door.

8.  APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY
DONNA HAYWARD stands at the door, carrying a covered meal tray. She checks a piece
of paper, doublechecks the address. And knocks.
DONNA
Hello? Mrs. Tremond? Meals On Wheels.
A long beat. Donna's about to step away. Then a voice from within:
VOICE
Enter.
Donna hesitates, tries the door. It's open. She hefts the tray, steps inside.

9.  TREMOND APARTMENT - DAY
A shadowy interior. Pill bottles of every size and description on litter the room. An old
woman, MRS. TREMOND, reclines in bed. A SMALL BOY stands before her. He wears
a dark suit. The boy's hands move gracefully through the air, perform a magic card trick.

The little boy repeats the magic trick. The old woman spits into the handkerchief, mutters.
It's as if Donna was invisible.
DONNA
Mrs. Tremond?
The old woman gestures toward a coffee table, more pill bottles, nearby.
TREMOND
Please.
Donna sets the tray upon the table, removes its cover. Reveals the meal beneath. The old
woman shifts, peers down at the hot food.
TREMOND
Cream corn. "I requested no cream corn.
DONNA
Sorry.
TREMOND
We detest yellow food.
DONNA
Next time, I'll...
As they speak, the little boy carries the tray to the old woman, arranges silverware. A
playing card slips into view, settles amidst warm chicken and rice.
TREMOND
My niece is a nurse. Sent me hospital food. Can you
imagine?
DONNA
Uhm, no.
TREMOND
Tastes like paste. I ordered Meals On Wheels myself.
Laura Palmer brought them to me. She's dead.

DONNA

TREMOND
No.
The old woman's reply is abrupt, final. She does not desire further conversation. Donna
sighs. She will learn nothing here.
DONNA
Enjoy your meal. I'll remember the corn.
Donna steps toward the door. Suddenly:
TREMOND
Young lady.
(off her look)
You might ask Mr. Smith next door. He was Laura's
friend. Mr. Smith does not leave his room.
DONNA
Thank you.
The little boy steps to Donna's side. He produces a red rose, sleight of hand, and offers it to
her. Donna smiles.

10.  APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY
Donna stands before apartment number 3, knocks. But no one answers. She scribbles a note,
slides it under the door.
Donna steps back to her car. Behind her, hands gently part pale curtains. Someone watches
her leaving.

11.  BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
BEN HORNE sits at his desk, a mill ledger spread out before him. JERRY HORNE
bounds about, nibbling on a block of cheese. Flames leap in the office fireplace.
Ben barks an order into the phone.
BEN
Tell Mrs. Horne I'm in a meeting.

Jerry pauses in front of Ben's desk. Gestures. As if to make a formal presentation.
JERRY
Ben, I'm struggling for understanding. Evidence to be
examined. Two mill ledgers.
BEN
One fake, one real.
JERRY
The real?
BEN
Josie was running a loser.
JERRY
The fake?
BEN
Catherine was covering it up.
JERRY
Criminally.
BEN
To our advantage. With our consent.
JERRY
Which brings us to Andrew Packard's will.
BEN
The ledger gambit guarantees the mill goes bankrupt, the
will gives Catherine the mill. Catherine sells to us and
pockets the cash.
The intercom buzzes, intrudes. Ben sighs, picks up the phone.
BEN
(into phone)
Now whit?! Tell her I'm still in a meeting.
Ben slams down the phone.
JERRY
So you promised Catherine the moon. Catherine eats
cheese instead.
Jerry offers Ben a bite from the block he's holding. Ben shakes it off, replies:

BEN
(puzzled)
I don't know. You?
JERRY
Stumped.
BEN
(using Jerry's lingo)
Eternal Query: What do women want?
JERRY
Doublestumped.
Jerry's pacing brings him back to the desk, the ledger spread out before him.
JERRY
(re ledger on desk)
So ... which ledger is this?

The fake.
JERRY
Bad news for Catherine.

Ben tosses the ledger to Jerry. Jerry tosses the ledger into the roaring fire. Both pause to
watch it burn.
Just then: a harried SECRETARY marches into the office.
BEN
I told you I'm in a meeting!
The secretary interrupts, holds out a note for his perusal.

13.  BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
Cooper, Truman, and Albert gather about PETE MARTELL at the dining room table.
Pete's dazed, a little singed around the edges.
PETE
She was afraid. I've never seen Catherine afraid before.
Well. When we went camping she killed a snake. And a
tree hit me one time. She had a reaction.
Albert rolls his eyes. But Cooper preempts him with a stern glance. Pete produces an
account ledger, places it on the table.
PETE
Catherine asked me to help her find the account ledger.
She asked me to help her.
(beat)
This was in her safe. Catherine said it was the wrong one.
TRUMAN
Josie showed me a second ledger.
ALBERT
(to Pete)
Sounds like your wife was cookin' the books.
PETE
We couldn't find it anywhere. But I found my high school
yearbook. Midge Jones.

Midge had blue eyes like a robin's egg. And a funny way
of walking. One foot here, one foot there, one foot here,

Amen to that.
ALBERT
Well bounce my butt out of the Glee Club. Gentlemen,
I've got a job to do.
COOPER
(to Pete)
Did Catherine tell you what was in the ledger?
PETE
Heavens no. But she was desperate to find it. Until the
phone rang and she was gone. I saw her car out front. The
mill was burning. So I went inside ...
Pete can't continue.
COOPER
I'm sorry, Pete. We all are.
PETE
Have you found ... her body?
Cooper shakes his head. No.
ALBERT
A mill fire burns somewhere close to two thousand
degrees, Mr. Martell. That's hot enough to incinerate
bone.
Cooper places a reproving hand on Albert's, stops him from continuing. Pete fixes Albert
with a baleful stare. A beat. Then, in a whisper:
PETE
Catherine's dead.
Pete sighs. Then stands, offers.

ALBERT
Gas cans found at the hot spot matched those in the back
of his truck.
COOPER
Catherine hired Leo to burn down the mill.
ALBERT
She gets a phone call. From Leo?
COOPER
Maybe something went wrong.
ALBERT
Wrong enough. Mill burns. Catherine with it.
COOPER
I want Shelly Johnson. She can put Leo at the scene.
Catherine too.

Meanwhile, Cooper and Albert continue. Truman spectates as before.
ALBERT
We need a look at Catherine Martell's will.
COOPER
Who stood to benefit from her death?
ALBERT
Who gets the mill? Or what's left of it.
COOPER
Life insurance.
ALBERT
I'll run the policy for beneficiaries.
Albert turns to Truman, sneers at his silence.
ALBERT
Don't be shy, Prince of Yokels. You too can participate in
the investigatory process.
Truman rises. Cooper grabs him by the arm. Just then: Pete interrupts.
PETE
(eyes on Albert)
Excuse me, boys. Coffee. Piping hot.
ALBERT
(muttered)
Morons and mooncalves, everywhere I go.
Pete carries a wooden tray into view. He speaks as he sets and pours coffee for four.
PETE
When I met Catherine, she was dating a fellow named
Rodney Pocquet. French-Canadian millionare's son.
Rich as Croesus. Rodney never said it, but he looked
down on me. I know he did. And why not? Rodney in
his fine summer suits. Me in my overalls and boots. I
never minded all that much.
(beat)
Until he started talking rude to me. Like I wasn't even
there. Rodney Pocquet hurt my feelings. He embarrassed
me in front of my friends. That made me mad.
Pete pauses, sets down the coffee pot. Albert wonders.

ALBERT

And I socked him on the jaw. Rodney never talked that
way to me again.
Albert looks to Cooper and Truman. He knows what's coming.
ALBERT
Not again.
They nod. And Pete floors Albert with a slow right cross to the jaw.

16.  THE DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
OPEN ON a police flyer. The official sketch of the long-haired man named Bob. And a
headline. HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN as he carefully attaches the
flyer to the inside of the Double R Diner doors. Andy's using scotch tape to affix the paper
flyer. He's managed to get a piece caught in his tufted hair. LELAND PALMER and
MADDY FERGUSON enter past Andy and move to a booth. Leland is resplendent in
sharp suit, bright white hair, and a whole new attitude. He nearly beams.

LELAND (CONTINUED)
Norma, two chocolate malteds, with a dollop of
whipped cream on the top.
NORMA
You're looking well, Mr. Palmer.
LELAND
I'm feeling well, thank you.
Norma moves back to the counter. Leland recounts a happy memory.
LELAND (CONTINUED)
Laura's favorite was a drink we used to call a Brown Cow.
It's like a root beer float only made with a cola drink
and vanilla ice cream. She had her first, with me, in that
booth right there.
MADDY
I'm glad you're feeling better, Uncle Leland.
LELAND
A man must take care of his family. And I still have a
family to take care of.
He reaches over, takes her hands. With pride.
LELAND (CONTINUED)
I'm coming through the pain, Maddy. I'm coming
through alive.

17.  DINER - DAY

lips, right next to the kissing part. And before I know it,
I'm grinning again.
NORMA
(trying not to be charmed)
No sale; you're thirty minutes late.
HANK
Okay, you found me out.
Hank produces a poloroid, holds it up for Norma to examine.
HANK
A 1965 GTO. Convertible. One owner. Forty thousand
miles. Clean and cherry.
NORMA
For what?
HANK
For you. It's a surprise, honey. Well, it was.
NORMA
Where will we get the money? The diner's barely
breaking even.
HANK
I put a little money away for something special. Trust
me, okay?
NORMA
(lightly)
Trust you?
Hank pulls Norma a little closer, brings his hips as close as propriety allows. Norma
reacts, but she doesn't move away. Hank nearly whispers.

Norma sets down the malteds.
LELAND
Thank you, Norma. Now, Maddy, a little piece of
heaven.
They try their malteds.
MADDY
Incredible.
LELAND
What did I tell you? Just another routine miracle of
everyday life here in Twin Peaks.
MADDY
Uncle Leland, you're doing all the right things.
LELAND
What do you mean, dear?
MADDY
When Dad died two years ago, I thought I'd never get
over it. Mom never has. It was focusing on the little
things that got me through it. The "everyday miracles."
LELAND
Life is a miracle. Maddy, I want to say something to
you, you don't have to answer, in fact you shouldn't. You
should think about it first. Promise first.
MADDY
Okay.

course, but stay in town. We're family, too. We can
make a family here.
MADDY

I don't know what to say.
LELAND
You shouldn't say anything until you eat that malted.
She smiles. They dig in.

MAJOR BRIGGS enters and sits at the counter, enjoys a cup of coffee, a little

LOG LADY
You wear bright objects on your chest.
MAJOR BRIGGS

Yes. I do.
LOG LADY
Are you proud?
MAJOR BRIGGS
Achievement is its own reward. Pride obscures it.

Deputy Andy marches up to reception, LUCY MORAN behind the sliding glass. He pulls
it open with a forceful tug. But Lucy glares ...
LUCY
No messages, Deputy Brennen.
... and slams it shut. Undaunted, Deputy Andy throws the glass partition open a second time,
even more forcefully. Lucy reacts with surprise.
ANDY
Listen to me, Lucy Moran. You just listen.
(a piece of tape still stuck to his head)
When the Tacoma Sperm Bank was looking for donors,
naturally I applied. But a routine physical revealed that I
was sterile. Sure, I thought it meant I didn't have to
bathe, but the doctors told me the truth. They told me I
can't have babies. So what I want to know now is why are
you having one? And how?
Lucy looks up at Andy, her lips quivering slightly. Then she reaches forward, as if to caress
him. Andy reacts, leans closer ... and Lucy TEARS the scotch tape from his head, closes the
glass door one last time.

HANK
Might've. You know me, Harry. I'm an impulsive guy.
Truman sighs, circles to his desk. Retrieves the appropriate form.
TRUMAN
I know enough not to waste my time on small talk. So
why don't you sign in like a good boy, and keep your nose
clean for another week.
Hank stares at Harry for a long beat. There is bad blood between them. Then he signs
without a word, turns on his heels, and steps out the door. A beat, then:
COOPER
How long were you and Hank friends?
TRUMAN
We grew up together. Ed, Hawk, Hank, myself.
Bookhouse Boys. Back then Hank was the best of us.
But he had a way of setting his heart on something, then
taking it. No matter how much it cost him. One day he
set his heart on Norma. And he took her from Big Ed.
"Never cheat a pal." That was our code. Hank broke it.
An intercom beeper interrupts. Lucy's VOICE is heard:
LUCY'S VOICE
Sheriff Truman? I have Ben Home on the phone for you.
The line with the light that's blinking.

BEN
Audrey has a penchant for the dramatic. The unexplained
disappearance, is, after all, a part of her repetoire. And
with Laura's killer in custody, well, you understand. No
need to panic.
Harry knows different. But Ben's attitude irks him just the same.
TRUMAN
I understand, Ben. We'll be in touch.
Ben exits. Harry turns to find Cooper in the office doorway, watching with evident concern.

LEO JOHNSON stares at the ceiling. At the future, at the past, at nothing at all. His eyes
are blank and fathomless.
SHELLY JOHNSON stands with DOC HAYWARD at his bedside. She is dressed in
hospital garb. Shelly peers at Leo with fear, muted revulsion. His death was something to
be wished for. But this intermediate state is beyond Shelly's ability to understand.
HAYWARD
The bullet lodged in Leo's spine. We removed it
successfully. As for possible paralysis, it's too early to
tell. Leo lost so much blood, most of it before we had a
chance to' operate...

Shelly's tone suggests she's not exactly pining for cure.
HAYWARD
We can maintain his current state. Offer him
nourishment, life support. But beyond that, our only ally
is time. I'm sorry, Shelly.
SHELLY
Me too. Arc they going to put him in prison?
HAYWARD
I know he's suspected of several felonies. But he can't be
charged with a crime until he's conscious or ruled
competent to stand trial.
SHELLY
I guess, at the moment, he's kind of in prison anyway.

Yes he is.

Ben sits behind his desk. Jerry enters, tosses a document upon it.
JERRY
One life insurance policy. Unsigned.
BEN

JERRY
The agent said Catherine was concerned about "certain

The agent wasn't supposed to show it to her.

Jerry starts to dial internationally. Ben picks up an extension. Just then: a cheery shout at the
door.
LELAND'S VOICE
Gentlemen!!
Ben looks up. Now what? Leland hops into the office, all smiles and manic energy.
LELAND
I've been giving this a lot of thought. The mill fire will
no doubt put contract signing on hold for the moment, so
we must insure that the moment, our moment, does not
pass. I would recommend a quick and cordialfollow-up

Einer know we're on top of it.

What's that? You heard about it how? Mr. Palmer called
you to tell you about the fire?
Leland gives a big "ok" sign to Ben. Jerry rolls his eyes.
BEN (CONTINUED)
No, I wouldn't call it a disaster at all. It was just one of
those things. An unfortunate development but I assure you
it in no way affects our developmcnt plans.
JERRY
Jerry Horne here, Einer. All systems go. Full speed

I would like, I deserve, a little fun in my day. Nothing
complicated. No big deal. just a little fun.

30.  ONE-EYED JACK'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT
An attractive Fifty-Two PICKUP carries a bucket of ice down the hall. Audrey lingers
outside a closed door, wonders.
AUDREY
I'll take it from here. Tag team.
The Pickup shrugs, offers the bucket. And her free hand to 'tag.' Audrey slaps her palm,
carries the ice inside.

31.  ONE-EYED JACKS ROOM - NIGHT
Emory Battis sits in a comfortable armchair, feet up. He wears an Oriental robe, a Santa's
cap, and a silk scarf tied around his eyes. His toenails have been painted bright red, cotton
balls between them as they dry.
Battis hears the door open, chirps:
BATTIS
Frosty? My little Snowman?
Audrey enters, sets the bucket at his feet. Battis, blindfolded, grins.
BATTIS
I feel a cold front moving in.
Audrey slips behind him, places her hands over the blindfold. Then slowly unties the knot
behind his head.
BATTIS
Mmmm. Better. Visible sin.
Audrey lets the loosened scarf slip down about his chin. Then, before he can react - she pulls
it tightly about his neck.
BATTIS
Hey!
AUDREY
Hiya, Mr. Battis. Remember me?
The voice, a glimpse of her face, tell Battis all he needs to know. He nods.
AUDREY
I'm gonna tell you a bedtime story. Are you listening?
With that she tugs the scarf a little tighter.
BATTIS
Yes. Yes.
AUDREY
Once upon a time there was this innocent little girl
named Red. That's me. And she met a horrible wolf.
That's you. And the wolf took her to a secret place and
did terrible things to her against her will. But the little
girl was tougher than she looked. She kicked the crap out
of the bad old wolf, and told her father all about it.
After that she told the police. And the bad old wolf
went to prison for a thousand years.
(CONTINUED)

As she speaks, Audrey twists the scarf tighter and tighter. Now she releases it. Battis gasps
for breath. At last:
BATTIS
What do you want?
AUDREY
I want to know everything you know. The perfume
counter. Laura Palmer. Ronette Pulaski. And One-Eyed
Jack's.
BATTIS
You're insane.
AUDREY
I'm Audrey Horne. And I get what I want. Understand?
Audrey moves as if to tighten the scarf again. Battis protests.
BATTIS
Yes. All right.
A long beat. Battis sighs. And begins:
BATTIS
I work for the owner of One-Eyed Jack's.
Audrey pulls on the scarf. Whenever Battis hesitates, is tempted to lie, she reins him in.
AUDREY
(she knows)
Who is?
BATTIS
Your father. He owns it all. Hell, he owns everything.
(beat)
I run girls through the perfume counter. I recruited
Ronnette and Laura.
AUDREY
Did Laura come here?
BATTIS
One weekend. She was using drugs, we threw her out. I
never saw her again. I swear.
AUDREY
Did my father know she was here?
(CONTINUED)

31. CONTINUED:(2)
BATTIS
Yes. Yes he did. Mr. Home makes it his business to
entertain all the girls.
AUDREY
Did she know Jac owned it.?
BATTIS
Owned what?
AUDREY
One-Eyed Jack's.
BATTIS
I don't know. Yes. Yes, she probably did.
Audrey finally drops the scarf from his neck. The information - her father, Laura - troubles
her deeply. Scares her too. A beat. Then, quietly:
BATTIS
Laura always got what she wanted. Just like you.
Understand?
The repetition chills her.

ACT FOUR
FADE IN:
32  HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT
JAMES HURLEY sits on a couch in the living room, holds a guitar in his hands. Donnna sits
in a chair nearby, watches him play.
It's a slow blues riff, snakes and ladders up the fret board. James concentrates with typically
solemn expression, lost in the music. Then he looks up, sees Maddy return to the room with
a soda.
Maddy smiles, sways to the music. Then, slowly, she begins to dance. It's a sweet sudden
moment. Maddy dancing across the carpet, hips rolling side to side, her body keeping
time. James stares at Maddy. The sexy steps. The easy smile. It could almost be Laura
dancing there.
Donna sees it too. She frowns, steps quickly from the room.
DONNA
Excuse me.
James abruptly stops playing. Maddy dances a single beat after, then freezes. James follows
Donna toward the kitchen.

33  HAYWARD HOUSE CORRIDOR - NIGHT
James catches up to her in the hall. He takes Donna by the arm. Donna whirls violently
about to face him.
JAMES
Donna, what's going on?
DONNA
Nothing.
JAMES
Donna -
Donna interrupts with a passionate embrace. James resists at first. But Donna will not be
dissuaded. She bites at his lips, offers soft kisses, then hard. James relents. And their
embrace deepens, gives rise to whispered moans. And the fevered kiss continues.
Finally: James pulls away, quite breathless. He looks at Donna in the shadows, as if uncertain
who is standing there.
JAMES
(confused)
Donna, what's going on?
(CONTINUED)

DONNA
(whispered)
I'm trembling, James. You made me.
Donna reaches for James, means to pull him back again. But a telephone rings OFFSCREEN. Doc Hayward's VOICE is heard.
HAYWARD'S VOICE
Donna. It's for you. Harold Smith?
Donna reacts. Steps away.

34.  HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT
Donna moves to the phone, answers.
DONNA
Hello? Mr. Smith?
SMITH'S VOICE
I received your note.
DONNA
I received yours.
SMITH'S VOICE
(beat)
Yes.
DONNA
(beat)
I'd like to talk to you.
SMITH'S VOICE
Tomorrow.
DONNA
Great. We can meet ... ?
SMITH'S VOICE
Here. At noon. The time we meet is critical.
DONNA
Oh. Okay.
SMITH'S VOICE
Tomorrow, Donna. I will show you what Laura gave me.
He hangs up. Donna holds the phone for a beat. Now sees James standing in a doorway,
wondering who she's talking to.

35.  HAYWARD LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Maddy sits alone. She feels a chill, looks to her right.
ANGLE ON DINING ROOM (Maddy's vision)
BOB, the long-haired man, sits-quietly at the dining, room table. Now he turns to face her,
returns Maddy's gaze.
BACK TO SCENE
Maddy screams. Donna and James rush back into the living room.
JAMES
Maddy!
James rushes to her side, takes Maddy into his arms. She's nearly in shock.
JAMES
What happened?
DONNA
Are you all right?
Maddy turns back toward the dining room, afraid of what she might see. But the long
haired man is gone.

SHELLY
Did you find out about the insurance?
BOBBY
I made a couple calls. Told 'em I was Leo's cousin. Leo
gets his disability as long as he's not in prison. It's a lot
of money, Shelly, over five thousand a month. But you
only get it if Leo stays at home.
SHELLY
I don't care about the money. I don't want Leo home.
BOBBY
Leo's in dreamland. We can stick him in a corner and
hang plants from his ears.
SHELLY
Sheriff Truman wants me to make a statement.
BOBBY
No way. Tell the Sheriff you got amnesia or something.
The fire twisted your brain.
SHELLY
I'm feeling pretty twisted right now.
BOBBY
They can't force you to testify against your husband. All
you got to do is get Leo home. Then sit back and collect
the checks.
(beat)
Leo owes you, baby. Now we can really make him pay.
You want something nice? We can buy it. You wanna go
someplace special, sit in the sun? It's on Leo.
Understand?
SHELLY
(warming to the idea)
It'd be nice not to worry about money. I got a shoebox
full of bills ...
BOBBY
Bills. Forget about bills. We're talkin' about a new life
here.
SHELLY

Together?

BOBBY
What do you think?
Bobby lifts Shelly's hand to his mouth, kisses it. He gently sucks on a finger. Shelly sighs.
SHELLY
I think I want to get comfortable.
Shelly flows into Bobby's arms, kisses him, playfully bites at his lip. Bobby hums with
pleasure.
SHELLY
Bobby Briggs, I'm gonna eat you up.
BOBBY
Promise?
SHELLY
Just watch me.
Bobby and Shelly sink down upon the couch to make love.

START CLOSE on Audrey's note to Agent Cooper, still hidden on the floor beneath his bed.
A trilling musical scale is HEARD from above.
CAMERA REVEALS Cooper on his bed, shoes off, holding his handmade wooden flute.
He pauses to glance at the television glowing in a corner. Then en activates the microrecorder positioned on a bedside table.

39. CONTINUED:
COOPER
Diane, I received bad news today. Windom Earle has
vanished. Audrey Home is missing. There is of course no
connection, except for the simple fact that my former
partner's disappearance seems to matter less to me than
that of a troublesome high school girl.
(beat)
Mr. Home is convinced she has run away and will return.
I wish I shared his confidence. Though not his callous
indifference.
(beat)
An all-points bulletin, routine checks of the train car and
Jacques' cabin have revealed nothing. Not a trace of her.
Cooper shuts off the recorder. As if to wonder. Then he starts it again. Speaks more softly:
COOPER
Audrey's absence touches me in ways I did not predict. I
find myself thinking not of clues or evidence, but of the
content of her smile. The way it gives the lie to her
delinquent posing, the hardened exterior which I suspect
is more a matter of self-preservation than a heart that is
cold. Audrey's heart is warm.
Cooper flicks off the recorder. Sets it on his bedside table. just then: a knock at the door.
COOPER
Just a minute.

Cooper rises with a wince - his wounds still give pain - and steps to the door. The last
time he opened it, Cooper received three slugs in the chest. This time he finds Major Briggs
standing there.
COOPER
Major Briggs.
BRIGGS
May I come in?
COOPER
Please.
Briggs enters, Cooper gestures toward the room's single chair. Briggs sits.
BRIGGS
I have a message for you.
COOPER
From whom?
BRIGGS
I am not at liberty to reveal the nature of my work. This
secrecy pains me from time to time. Any bureaucracy
that functions in secret inevitably lends itself to
corruption. But these are the rules I have pledged to
uphold. I believe a pledge is sacred.
COOPER
Speaking as both a man and a fellow employee of the
federal government so do I.
BRIGGS
I may reveal this much. Among my many tasks is the
maintenance of deep space monitors aimed at galaxies
beyond our own. We routinely receive various
communications, space garbage to decode and examine.
The results look something like this.
Briggs produces a paper readout, holds it out for Cooper to examine. The sheet is covered
with letters, numbers, signifying nothing.
BRIGGS
Radio waves and gibberish, Agent Cooper. Until Friday
night. Saturday morning, to be exact.
COOPER

BRIGGS
The readout took us by surprise.
Briggs holds out another paper readout, the usual jumbled numbers and letters. And a
message at its center: THE OWLS ARE NOT WHAT THEY SEEM. Cooper examines
the message, wonders:
COOPER
Why did you bring this to me?
Briggs holds out one last readout.
BRIGGS
Later that morning.
Cooper looks at the paper. More letters, numbers. And something else, quite recognizable,
repeated over and over. COOPER. COOPER. COOPER. Cooper reacts, exchanges a
look with Briggs.

START CLOSE on LELAND PALMER, his face a dark mask of grief. SHERIFF
TRUMAN'S voice is heard:
TRUMAN'S VOICE
Leland, you have the right to an attorney.
(beat)
Leland ... ?
LELAND
(with a wave of the hand)
No, no. I waive that right. I'm a lawyer ...
VOICE
I'm going to ask you some questions. Anything you say
may be held against you in a court of law. Do you
understand?
LELAND
Yes. Of course.
TRUMAN'S VOICE
(after a beat)
On Friday morning, March third, did you go to
Calhoun Memorial Hospital?
Leland answers quietly, intent, as if commenting on the actions of someone else.
LELAND
Yes
TRUMAN'S VOICE
Why did you go there?
LELAND
I was looking for someone.
TRUMAN'S VOICE
Who were you looking for?
LELAND

LELAND
No. Yes. I do now. Jacques Renault.
TRUMAN
What made you think he killed Laura?
LELAND
(steadfast)
You arrested him.
TRUMAN
Leland ... did you kill Jacques Renault?
LELAND
(his eyes shine with unshed tears)
He killed my Laura. The things he did to her... have
you ever experienced ... absolute loss?
COOPER
(gently)
I doubt any of us is a stranger to grief.
LELAND
(looking into his heart)
It's more than grief. So deep inside you, every cell
screams. You hear nothing else.
(beat)
Yes I killed him. Yes, Yes, Yes ...
Leland Palmer breaks down and cries. Truman, Cooper, and DOC HAYWARD arrayed
about the weeping man. HOLD ON this tableau for a beat.

2.  SHERIFF'S STATION HALLWAY - DAY
Cooper and Doc Hayward exit interrogation and walk down a station hallway.
COOPER
He'll plead temporary insanity.
HAYWARD
We'll need a psychiatric exam. I can tell you this.
Parents should not bury their children. Anyone who's
suffered what Leland has ...

COOPER

Do you approve of murder, Doctor Hayward?
HAYWARD
No.
But in this case, his tone suggests, he's considered the exception.

3.  SHERIFF'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY
DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN fidgets in the reception area. Tries hard not to look like he's
waiting for someone. When Doc Hayward and Cooper enter, Andy nearly shouts.
BRENNAN
Hey Doc!
HAYWARD
How are you, Andy?
ANDY
Fine. Great. Fine.
Andy's smile is false. A beat.
HAYWARD
What the problem?
ANDY
(looking left and right)
It's sort of personal.
HAYWARD
I'm your doctor, Andy.
Andy hesitates. This is quite difficult for him. At last, almost in a whisper.
ANDY
It's about my sperms test.
HAYWARD
(prompting)
Yes ...?
ANDY
You know ... I flunked.

HAYWARD
That's not the precise term for it ...
ANDY
Well I was just wonderin' if it's the kind of test you can
take over, you know, like a driver's exam? I mean I've
been wearing boxer shorts every day like you told me -
HAYWARD
You'd like to give it another shot.
ANDY
Yes sir I would.
HAYWARD
Well then I'll need a sample to take with me.
Hayward sifts through his Gladstone, hands Andy a small sample jar. Andy pales.
ANDY
Right now?
HAYWARD
Put it in a brown paper bag. I'll wait in the car.
Doc exits. Andy glances wildly about the reception room. No one's looking. He spots the
box full of "FLESH WORLD" magazines.

4.  SHERIFF'S STATION HALLWAY - DAY
Coming around a corner, Andy and LUCY MORAN nearly collide. She's lugging a
coffeemaker. He's toting a couple of FLESH WORLDS, which he promptly drops. Lucy
spots the pornography, then peers over Andy's shoulder, his destination beyond. The MEN'S
ROOM. Lucy shakes her head sadly and storms off Andy watches her vanish with a wince.

5.  RECEPTION - DAY
Truman and Cooper sit in reception with coffee, taking a breather. Cooper cases himself into
a chair with a grimace, as Truman runs down the day's business.

TRUMAN
Last of the frontiersmen. They broke the mold.
COOPER
Bail hearing for Leland. Leo's competency examination.
TRUMAN
That's the agenda. Does Leland get bail?
COOPER
That's up to your state prosecutor.
TRUMAN
Daryl Lodwick. Also on his way.
COOPER
What do we hear from Hawk?
TRUMAN
(off notes)
Called this morning. County says nobody by the name
of 'Robertson' ever lived next to the Palmers. Got a
forwarding address on the last occupants; Kalispell.
He'll check it by afternoon.
(a little disappointed by the paucity of leads)
That's it.
Cooper sips his coffee.

5A.  HALLWAY - DAY
Andy exits the bathroom, holding a small paper bag. He hurries around the corner, bumps
into a coatrack and drops the bag. The bag opens and the sample rolls away down the hall,
coming to rest under a chair in reception. Andy hurries after it, diving past Cooper and
Truman to retrieve it. Cooper sees the bottom of Andy's new boots.
COOPER
Andy, don't move -
(Andy freezes, his hand on the sample)
Andy, where did you get those?

ANDY
Oh. I'm sorry. Phillip Gerard sold 'em to me
yesterday when he was waiting. Sorry.
COOPER
(pointing out the sole to Truman)
These are the same brand of shoe we found at Leo
Johnson's. The giant said There was a clue out there.
TRUMAN

Wentz travels incognito, using only cash. No credit
cards, no way to trace his identity. Or hers. No one at
the paper even knows who he or she is.
BEN
(figuring the benefit)
A favorable Wentz review can spell big business.
CLERK

He's coming, he's coming he's coming -
BEN

Keep an eye on registration. I want hourly updates.
Scrutinize every check-in -
DESK CLERK
Especially if they pay cash.
HORNE

It's not even nine thirty and you've already done a good

Ben turns on his heels, walks away without another word.

8.  BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
Ben enters his office, stops short. JEAN RENAULT sits on his desk, beside a portable
television set, complete with built-in video cassette player.
RENAULT

RENAULT
We've met. I sell 'insurance' to small businesses. Like
One-Eyed Jack's.
The mention catches Ben's attention. He closes the door behind him. Steps closer.
BEN
Jean Renault. What's the occasion? Are my premiums
about to be raised?
Renault produces a video tape, inserts it into the television. Presses PLAY. Ben stops
suddenly, pales: Audrey appears on screen, drugged, incoherent. Her wrists visibly bound.
BEN (CONTINUED)
You bastard.
RENAULT
Don't make a mistake, Mr. Horne. I'm just the
messenger.
BEN
For whom?
Renault shakes his index finger. He will dictate the terms of their discussion from this point
on. Renault FREEZE-FRAMES Audrey's image, continues:
RENAULT
There are terms. Would you like to hear them?
BEN
Yes.
RENAULT
They request a large sum of money -
BEN
How much?
RENAULT
I require something else, entirely.
BEN
They should bear the cost of their own middleman -
RENAULT
They can't give me what I want. Would you like to hear
what I want?

#2.004

BEN
Yes.
RENAULT
Number one your business up there is run by pickpockets
and fools. Every dollar earned, there's a dollar stolen.
Are you aware of that?
BEN
(beat, doesn't want to appear disadvantaged)
I have my suspicions.
RENAULT
What you need is a partner. Who could take care of your
little problem.
BEN
I already have a partner.
RENAULT
Okay. Do you want my help or not?
BEN
Yes. Yes.
RENAULT
One more thing.
Renault presses FAST-FORWARD on his remote. He stops the tape at a familiar image:
Cooper in tuxedo, seated at one of the casino's blackjack tables. Ben reacts to Cooper's image
with surprise, trepidation. What's Cooper doing in his casino?
RENAULT (CONTINUED)
I want this man to deliver the ransom.
BEN
Why? That man's a Federal agent.
RENAULT
Do you want your daughter back?
BEN
Of course, but I can't involve -

That's supposed be an equitable exchange?
Jean smiles. He can't help but appreciate Ben's venality under pressure.
RENAULT
This could turn out well. I'll leave the video. It could
help clarify your thinking. Expect a call tomorrow.
Noon.
He exits. A long beat. And Ben steps to his desk, picks up the the phone, punches a button:

HANK
You're looking real pretty today, Donna.
DONNA

Thanks.
HANK
(re trays)
Special occasion?
DONNA
Lunch with ... someone I met on my route.
HANK
(cheery)
Bed pans and shut-ins. Who's to meet?
DONNA
You wouldn't understand.
Donna reacts to the slight with muted anger. As if to defend the absent Harold Smith. She
grabs the trays, heads for the door. HANK eyes her figure as she exits. NORMA JENNINGS
hurries into view, interrupts his reverie:
NORMA
Hank, listen to this: Louie called from the Northern.
M.T. Wentz is coming to Twin Peaks.
HANK
Empty who?
NORMA
Only the most powerful restaurant critic in the state. A
good review in a Seattle paper could mean a lot of
business. He's going to try and send him our way.
HANK

Then we've still got time.
NORM

HANK
I'll pick up some flowers, maybe some candles and
tableclothes - now what could we put on the menu, some
specials maybe -
NORMA
I've always wanted to do some regional dishes -
HANK
Babe, we're gonna trick this joint out like Christmas in
July.
Hank grabs some cash from the register, gives Norma a kiss, steps toward the door. Norma
smiles, moved by his boyish enthusiasm. It's the man with whom she fell in love.
HANK
Oh, and I think you ought to give Big Ed a call.
NORMA
(not ready for this)
Why?
HANK
(seeming innocence)
You're still friendly, right? So maybe this Wentz fella
stops in for gas, suggest the Double R to any
new faces he sees.
NORMA

10.  HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT DAY
HAROLD SMITH carefully sets Donna's trays atop a blanket before her. He's turned his
living room into an indoor picnic; silverware and plates, he's even produced a wicker basket.
Donna watches, impressed.
SMITH
(quiet charm)
How many agoraphobics do you know who own a picnic
basket?
DONNA
Not too many, I guess.
Smith sits across from her, cross-legged, with a smile.
SMITH
The food looks delicious. Thank you.
DONNA
I wanted it to be special.
SMITH
It is. Very. What am I thinking? We should have wine.
Smith leaps up, energized, he steps toward a door, opens it to reveal a wine rack inside.
SMITH
Any requests?
DONNA
(quietly admiring)
Don't ask me. All the boys I know drink beer.
SMITH
I'll select something appropriate. The Germans
practically invented picnic wine. Sprechen Sie Deutsch?
DONNA
Parlez vous Francais?

SMITH
Of course; you speak a Romance language.
Smith opens the wine with subtle ceremony, pours a little into a glass for Donna to sample.
She looks at him, wonders. He nods, prompts. Donna takes a little sip.
DONNA
Wow.
(more adult)
It's very good. Thanks.
Smith smiles, pours the rest. He holds up his glass.
SMITH
What shall we drink to?
DONNA
(after a beat)
To Laura.
SMITH
To Laura. In our hearts and memories.
They touch glasses. A spark passes between them. Smith reaches toward an end table, grasps
Laura's diary. The one Donna spotted there previously. Donna reacts. Smith looks at her; can
see the eager curiosity in her eyes.
SMITH (CONTINUED)
Her diary. Did I tell you I had this?
DONNA
(masking)
Laura's diary?
SMITH
Would you like me to read? It seems appropriate.
DONNA
Please.
Smith turns through the diary, selects a page. He begins.
SMITH
"But still I'm afraid to tell her of my fantasies and my
nightmares; sometimes she's good at understanding,
other times she just giggles, and I don't have the nerve to
ask why things like that are funny to her."

Donna reacts. She knows exactly to whom Laura is referring. Smith continues:
SMITH (CONTINUED)
"So I feel badly again and shut up about it for a long
time. I love Donna very much, but sometimes I worry
that she wouldn't be around me at tall if she knew what
my insides were like. Black and dark, and soaked with
dreams of big, big men and different ways they might
hold me and take me into their control ..."
Smith reads the latter without emotion, an even odder twist to Laura's musing. Donna
reacts, saddened, embarrassed somehow. She wants Smith to stop and he can see it.
SMITH
Is something wrong?
DONNA
I'm just thinking, I mean, isn't that evidence? Shouldn't
we give it to Sheriff Truman?
SMITH
No.
(less intense)
I've read this from cover to cover, Donna. There are no
solutions here. Besides, she gave it it to me.
DONNA
Why?
SMITH
Safekeeping. Laura knew about my work.
DONNA
(working on him)
I don't know anything about it.
SMITH

No. You don't.

Donna shivers. With a quiet thrill, some anticipation. And just a sliver of fear.

Man talked real quiet. Wouldn't give his name.
JOSIE

BATTIS
C'mon, Dreamboat, daddy's waiting.
Emory shoves her down into a chair. Renault reacts with a frown.
BATTIS
Miss Home has been a very bad girl. Refusing to take
her medicine.
AUDREY

No more. Please.
Battis scoffs. But Renault surprises him.
RENAULT
Audrey, have you been mistreated?
Battis reacts. What the hell is this? Audrey pauses, then looks hard at Battis.
AUDREY

He hit me.
BATTIS
I did not hit her. If that's what you're thinking. I didn't.
RENAULT

That was wrong. It will never happen again. For as long
as you are with me. Do you understand?
(Audrey manages a nod)
I spoke to your father this morning. You're in no danger.
Everything's going to be fine. You do trust me, don't
you Audrey?
Renault's voice is hypnotically soothing. His concern seems genuine. Audrey feels safe
somehow. Battis steps back to Audrey, sits in a chair beside her. As if to rejoin the team.
BATTIS
You see, Audrey, in a situation like this, people have to
handle themselves in a professional manner. We're all
reasonable people. Something reasonable can be worked

He never exercises. He never washes his car, and he
doesn't own a sports coat.
COOPER
Uh-huh, and did you do something about this?
LUCY
After watching a television show, I decided I needed
some "me" time, during which we didn't see each other,
during which period I met Dick Tremayne, Horne's
Department Store, Men's Fashions. He had many coats
and keeps himself and his car in good shape. Most of

Why don't we finish up in the kitchen.
Hank ushers him into the kitchen. OFF CAMERA a number of pots and pans crash. Hank

29.  DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT
The darkened interior of the diner after hours. A doorbell is HEARD. A beat. Hank Jennings
steps into the room wearing sweats, a sleepy expression, turns on an interior light, opens the
front door. Nobody's there. Mutters, turns off the lights, and heads back to bed.
A beat. And the doorbell RINGS a second time. A quiet noise is heard. And appliance
lights, dim illumination, go dark in the shadows.
HANK'S VOICE
What the ...?
Hank Jennings stumbles back into view. He tries the light switch. But this time nothing. The
room remains dark. Hank fumbles through a drawer, produces a flashlight. He turns it on.
Suddenly: the beam reveals Jonathan, the Asian Man. Hank reacts with surprise. He keeps
the beam trained on the Asian Man's face, as if to blind him.
HANK
(cool and calm)
Okay. What's the deal? What do you want?
Hank makes his move. He swings the heavy flashlight at the Asian Man's head. But the Asian
Man dodges the weapon with ease, catches Hank at the elbow, directs him forward, crashing
into tables and chairs. The flashlight rolls on the floor, Hank retrieves it, gets to his feet
and aims a high kick at the Asian Man's head. It's a glancing blow, but enough to knock the
man off-balance.
Hank attacks, the Asian man avoids his rush, sends him flying into a large refrigerator. Hank
gasps, regroups. And charges again. This time the Asian Man plows a fist into his midsection,
adds a blow to the back of Hank's neck. Hank lies still on the floor, huffs and puffs.
HANK
Listen, I'm just gonna ... lie here for a while.
The Asian Man kneels, retrieves the flashlight, aims it at him, steps toward Hank. Silent.
HANK
What? What?
The Asian Man stands over Hank, the flashlight aimed at his eyes. Hank puts up his arms to
defend. But the Asian Man simply grabs him by the hand, brings their thumbs together - a
bloodless approximation of Hank and Josie's partner ritual.
JONATHAN
Bloodbrother. Next time I'll take off your head.
He smashes the flashlight against a counter.

1.  GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - MORNING
Establish.

2.  COOPER'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING
COOPER sits on the edge of the bed in his boxer shorts. Flips on his tape recorder.
COOPER
Diane, it's 6:42 a.m., a bit of a late start, due to a
persisting soreness in the rib area ...
(rises tentatively)
An ache that feels as if a wing were cut away in my
sleep.
(approaching)
Diane, a strange dream to report: I dreamt I was
eating a large, tasteless gumdrop. I soon awoke to
realize I was aggressively munching on one of my
Air-Pillow Silicon Ear Plugs. Hence the
tastelessness. I suspect some unexpressed feeling of
aggression is responsible.
(drops to crouch)
Diane, rather than equilibrate through the use of my
gravity boots, which could induce further rib
separation, this morning I'm going to attempt a
headstand.
(rolls up onto the wall)
I'm now upside down, my mind becoming porous,
the day tasks coming into focus, objects growing
clearer ...
Looking out in the darkness of the stained wood floor, which now looks to us like the ceiling.
Cooper sees a white envelope under, or rather over, the bed. Cooper unfurls and reaches for
it.
COOPER
(reads)
"My special agent ..."

Diane, the Giant was right. I did forget something
He opens the envelope, pulls out the card and reads Audrey's lost note.

TRUMAN

I was afraid we lost you to the Kalispell woods.
HAWK
A pair of retired female schoolteachers lived in that
house next to the Palmers. The name's not
Robertson and they had no memory of a greyhaired
man. Had to drink three pots of camomile tea to
find that out.

TRUMAN
All right. The one-armed man's come back into the
picture. Take a look, so far we've struck out.
LUCY MORAN walks up carrying a day bag and looking a little teary-eyed.
LUCY
Excuse me, Sheriff, I'm sorry to interrupt, but
Sheriff, I just wanted to say goodbye because as you
know, I'm going down to Tacoma for two days to
visit my sister, Gwen and her husband, Larry, who
had a baby last week, you remember, it was a boy
and as soon as the Can Do temp girl gets here I'll
explain the phones and the coffee and the intercom
and the Wagon Wheel Do-Nut run and ... and ...
TRUMAN
Lucy. It's okay.
LUCY
No, she should have been here by now, I can wait and
at least show her ... show her ...
TRUMAN
Lucy. Go.
With silent gratitude, she picks up her bag and exits ahead of Hawk. Cooper then enters,
eyes cool, intently ablaze. Both he and Truman instinctively step toward an empty corridor.
COOPER
Harry -
TRUMAN
'You get word on our delivery tonight?
COOPER
We won't need it. We've got the jump on them.

7.  LEO JOHNSON'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
A hospital bed has replaced the living room sofa. In a wheelchair beside the bed sits BOBBY
BRIGGS, allowing the medical supplies salesman, TIM PINKLE, to demonstrate a lifting
apparatus. Pinkle is a pasty, perspiration-prone man with an affectation of high duty.
SHELLY JOHNSON stands a step removed, looking on.
PINKLE
The Port-O-Patient will allow you to fluently
transport the unfortunate Mr. Johnson, allowing him
even to sit outside and experience what he can of
nature.
BOBBY
(resolutely)
Mr. Pinkle, I want my cousin Leo to have the fullest
possible experience of life.
PINKLE
That's what we're here for. Let's take
Pinkle inspects the electrical engine that, along with the rest of the host, looks to be quite
antiquated. Bobby sits in the loose body sling connected to an overhead bar by two sagging
crossing chains, giving this crane-like device the look of a silvery praying mantis.
SHELLY
Mr. Pinkle are you going to put in a ramp.
PINKLE
Ah... sure. I've got some plywood, uh, pinewood
ramp boards I'll install outside. Absolutely.
Pinkle finds the switch to start the engine.
PINKLE (CONT'D)
Okay, here we go.
He flips the switch. Nothing happens.
PINKLE (CONT'D)
That's a new wrinkle. It was working the other day.
Pinkle fiddles with the cord to the socket. Nothing. Suddenly the engine starts. The bar jerks
up and the chains snap tight across a frightened Bobby, who's yanked up from his seat and
tossed back down. Then the machine stops. Flashing Pinkle a homicidal look, Bobby fights his
way out of the chains, sling, and chair.
SHELLY
Bobby, 'you alright?
(CONTINUED)

#2.005
7. CONTINUED:
BOBBY
How about getting Mr. Pinkle a cold drink?
As Shelly leaves, Bobby pulls Pinkle aside by the back of his neck.
BOBBY
That thing's a death trap, Pinkle. I told you we have
to keep him alive.
PINKLE
Insurance companies don't exactly pay off like the
slots. After both our cuts, it was either this or a firstrate wheelbarrow.
Shelly returns. Pinkle takes the soda and dives into tinkering with the machine.
SHELLY
(needs a private word)
Bobby?
(beat)
I've got to meet Leo's lawyer.
BOBBY
(taking her into the kitchen)
The hearing's today, right?
PINKLE (O.S.)
Be just another second, folks.
SHELLY
Bobby, are we okay?
His response is a passionate stare. She smolders back. With Pinkle about, they can do no
more than look and want. But outside ... Bobby takes her hand.
BOBBY
Come on, he can let himself out.
They exit. Pinkle, studies the non-working hoist. After a moment he climbs up into the sling.
Testing. He shouts back to Bobby.
PINKLE (CONT'D)
Probably a short in the switch.
Pinkle reaches down and hits the switch a couple of time; finally, the bar lifts, the chains
tighten and the salesman rises.
PINKLE (CONT'D)
There we go ...

7. CONTINUED:(2)
But the machine doesn't stop, lifting Pinkle up to a precarious height and pulling him back,
his arms pinned by the crossing chains.
PINKLE (CONT'D)
Hit that switch down there, would you, Bobby?
(increasingly strangulated)
Bobby? ... Bobby?

8.  ROADHOUSE - DAY
Establish.

9.  ROADHOUSE - DAY
The entry doors have been closed, the tables pushed against the front wall. Two rows of
chairs face a long, solid judge's table at the back of the room. Andy escorts Leland past
Cooper and Truman, standing near the door, to a defendant's table in the front row. The
prosecutor's table sits alongside, SARAH PALMER and MADDY FERGUSON sit behind
Leland in the second row, along with a few habitual COURT WITNESSES. Leland takes
Sarah's hand for a moment.
The small group stands as JUDGE CLINTON STERNWOOD, all in shining black robes,
strides expansively into the room; a rich, magisterial presence and powerful, uncluttered
eyes. His trailed by SID, his bailiff. Appraising the prosecutorless situation, Sternwood stops
beside Cooper and Truman.
STERNWOOD
Morning. Where's Lodwick the prosecutor?
TRUMAN
Hasn't shown.
STERNWOOD
(nods; there'll be a delay)
Took a long constitutional this morning. The path
leading down to the waterfall. A fine, invigorating
mist in the air. There was a twelve-point buck
drinking from the pool; he saw me but didn't bolt.
Time stood still. I In the presence of the eternal, I
suppose that's as it should be.

BEN HORNE has entered, late, immediately makes his way to the power in the room.
STERNWOOD
Benjamin.
HORNE
Your Honor, a pleasure, sorry I missed you last night.
STERNWOOD
Your dining room served a wild boar with a cherry
sauce that I haven't yet found the words to describe.
(to Cooper)
I've been around the Great Northern since the dawn
of man. Hammered my way through law school
there.
HORNE
Clinton worked construction for my father. In my
boyhood memory he built half the hotel singlehandedly.
COOPER
There's a door near my room, opening out to the
back, that's like nothing I've ever seen. Two panel
oak, all joined with tongues, tenons, and dowels.
Not a nail or a screw in it.
STERNWOOD
Thank you. I remember that door. Dryclamped and
lying in the sun. Beautiful piece of work -
DARRYL LODWICK, the state prosecutor, arrives, apologetically approaching Sternwood.
LODWICK
Sorry, I had a bit of trouble. Lost my wallet.
STERNWOOD
(dryly)
Enter the State.

8.
#2.005
10.  ROADHOUSE - DAY
Sitting alone and imposing at his long table, Sternwood GAVELS and commences.
STERNWOOD
Mr. Palmer has pleaded not guilty to the charge of
murder in the first degree. Defense has requested
bail. This is a pretrial hearing to determine if that
bail will be granted. Mr. Prosecutor ...
LODWICK
We, the people of the state of Washington, move that
the defendant be denied bail on the basis of: 1)the
great seriousness of the crime for which he's been
accused; 2) the apparently premeditated nature of
this act; and 3) the oft-witnessed instability of Mr.
Palmer during the period following the death of his
daughter.
All eyes are on Leland as Lodwick sits.
STERNWOOD
Sheriff Truman will speak for the defense.
TRUMAN
Mr. Palmer is a well-known, respected member of
this community, with a good professional reputation
and established roots. And beyond that ... I'd like
to say that none of us can really know what it's like to
lose a seventeen year-old daughter the way he did.
What that might do to any one of us ...
(suddenly self-conscious)
That's all.
Sternwood deliberates. Truman takes his seat beside Andy, who is glancing up and over a
row up at Leland's partial profile. Truman glances down at the sketchpad in Andy's lap and
sees ...
Andy's sketch of Leland, from the same angle as just seen by Truman: a profile favoring the
back left side of the head.
Andy notices Truman's attention.
ANDY
I thought I might sell this to the Gazette. They
seem to like courtroom sketches.
TRUMAN
You might try for a little more of his face. Just a
suggestion.
(CONTINUED)
9.
#2.005
10. CONTINUED:
ANDY
Good. Thanks, Sheriff.
Sternwood gavels.
STERNWOOD
On the basis of his high standing in the community,
the pristine nature of his public and private
reputation and his evident respect for the letter of the
law, which is well known to me ... defendant is
released on his own recognizance. Leland, as you
know, I'll require you to remain in town, making
your whereabouts known to the Sheriff on a regular
basis. Sid, check the calendar. We'll set the date for
Mr. Palmer's trial.
Reactions all round: for Leland, a shred of dignity retained.

HAROLD SMITH leads DONNA HAYWARD in, sits behind his mahogany desk. DONNA
HAYWARD sits in the antique chair opposite.
HAROLD
So, what behind those deep blue eyes today?
DONNA
I've got a proposition for you.
HAROLD
(half-flirting)
Now you've got my attention.
DONNA
I'll share my fife with you. I'll tell it to you. Be a

If I can read Laura's diary.

DONNA
Acceptable.
HAROLD
You'll start?
DONNA
Acceptable.
Harold undoes the secret bookshelf. Donna tries not to make an obvious point of observing.
He tries to casually conceal the fact he's concealing how the locking mechanism works. He
takes out a fresh ledger, lays Laura's diary on the desk beside him, makes a show of taking
out an expensive fountain pen and cracks open the new book.
HAROLD
(writing in the frontispiece)
Donna ... Hayward.
(smiles, simply)
Begin ...
DONNA
Alright. I'm from Twin Peaks. That is I was born
here. My father delivered me. He's a doctor.
Where are you from?
HAROLD
I grew up in Boston. Actually, I grew up in books.
DONNA
There are things you can't get from books.
HAROLD
There are things you can't get anywhere. But we
dream they can be found in other people. Continue.
Donna stands, comes over to the desk coquettishly along its edge.
DONNA
Maybe our dreams are real.
Harold nervously pull back. Donna quickly grabs Laura's diary and playfully steps away.

DONNA
Maybe I'll read it out here on the lawn.
HAROLD
Give that back to me, please.
DONNA
Why don't you come out with me? Come on.
What's there to be afraid of?
She backs through the open doorway. He bolts forward; but suddenly it's as if she's backed
over a cliff. His face flushes at the flood of daylight. A trembling ignites in his fingers.
HAROLD
Oh God ... oh God ...
DONNA
Harold?
He gets down on the ground, hyperventilating, looking almost paralyzed.
DONNA (CONTINUED).
Harold?
His breathing locks. She hurries to him, kneels down, half-props him against her chest, he
grasps at her, trying to breathe again.
DONNA
It's all right. It's all right. I'm so sorry.
HAROLD
I just ... I just got too close.
DONNA
To what?
As his panic fades, seeking and finding permission in her eyes, he kisses her tenderly. They
look at each other.

FADE IN:
13.  ROADHOUSE - DAY
Leo Johnson competency hearing. Judge Sternwood is holding court, facing Prosecutor
Lodwick and JACK RACINE, a sardonic defense attorney representing Leo Johnson.
We begin CLOSE ON a blown-up photograph of Leo Johnson, before and after injury and a
diagram on an easel Racine is showing to the judge and closeby gallery area, occupied by
Cooper, Truman, and Shelly Johnson. The diagram is of two EEG waves, one large and
varied, the other flat and undisclosing.
RACINE
You can see by these EEG's, the one above, which is
actually of my own head and intended to show
normal brain activity . The line below is of Mr.
Johnson and shows minimal activity. The previously
submitted medical report states that Mr. Johnson has
suffered diffuse brain damage. He isn't currently
even capable of taking the standard CST
competency tests. We therefore submit that trying
this individual would constitute a mockery of the
justice system, a proceeding the unfortunate young
man wold not even faintly comprehend.
Racine withdraws.
STERNWOOD
Mr. Prosecutor.
Lodwick stands, takes a posturing step toward an almost empty gallery, and accidentally
makes eye contact with Shelly Johnson before folding back toward the judge.
LODWICK
I know that Leo Johnson isn't in very good shape. On
the surface, it might seem ridiculous to make him
stand trial. But a trial doesn't just punish a
wrongdoer; it also brings a feeling of justice and
retribution to a community. Among the various
crimes he's suspected of, the murder of Laura Palmer
is the sort that can wound an entire town.

LODWICK (continued)
For there to be even a shred of feeling that the
perpetrator of this terrible crime got away with it -
(Sternwood starts to wave him off)
- this simply cannot be. As long as Leo Johnson
carries a breath, he is as eminently deserving of a
trial as this community is of a resolution -
STERNWOOD
All right, have a seat, Mr. Lodwick. You fellas catch
your breath, I'm going to need to deliberate.
(rises)
Mr. Cooper, Sheriff Truman if I could have the
pleasure of your company ...
Sternwood waves them over to join him at the bar.
STERNWOOD (CONT'D)
Sid, how about fixing me up a Black Yukon on Sucker
Punch?
Sid contentedly goes to work behind the bar, concocting an elaborate drink. Cooper and
Truman flank Sternwood at the bar.
STERNWOOD (CONT'D)
Lodwick really planted his feet and looked it in the
eye. I didn't think he'd press on the murder charge.
Is Leo Johnson your man?
COOPER
No, sir, I don't believe he is.
STERNWOOD
Harry, what's the town's temperature? Do they want
a trial or a lynching?
TRUMAN
They want the right man brought to justice.
STERNWOOD
Then they don't a need a circus. This poor bastard
seems to be a head of cabbage. Thoughts, Cooper?
COOPER
I feel the right man will eventually be apprehended.

When medically possible, he may be sent home.
Harry, maybe you'd like to tell the little lady
yourself.
Truman nods gratefully, moves to Shelly.
STERNWOOD (CONT'D)
How long you been here, Cooper?
COOPER
Close to two weeks, sir.
STERNWOOD
I'll advise you to keep your eye on the woods. The
woods are wondrous here. But strange.
Sternwood drinks his drink, his eye on some distant, sinister horizon. Truman kneels down
beside Shelly, who, distracted, doesn't notice him at first.
TRUMAN

JEAN RENAULT sits at his desk in shirtsleeves, one sleeve rolled up for him to strap a knifelauncher into his forearm. Its black metal chute holds the knife against a taut spring up near
the elbow. BLACKIE watches.
RENAULT
Cooper hands me the briefcase. I take it.
Renault thrusts out his forearm as if to take a briefcase. With a distinct sound, the knife
whistles down the chute and bolts to a stop well past the hand area, a show of gleaming,
finest-cut steel blade.
BLACKIE
What about Ben Horne?
RENAULT
He relinquishes control of Jack's. It's all yours.
BLACKIE
With his daughter dead?
RENAULT
You love a good steak, but you don't want to know
how it got on your plate.
(reloads his knife)
With Battis gone and Home out of the way, you're
going to have to get serious about your business,
Blackie.
BLACKIE
(pause)
How are you going to do the girl?
Renault motions to a syringe, drugs and chemistry set on his desk. Blackie moves seductively
towards Renault, with an eye on the drugs.

In the other room.
Blackie exits.
RENAULT
The girl asleep?
NANCY
Dreamland.
RENAULT
Does she dream of fishes? Of dark lake beds and
tangled weeds?
Renault caresses her leg, pulls a knife from her boot. Nancy doesn't move.
NANCY
What about Blackie? I've waited long enough.
RENAULT
We'll have our fun tonight.
Renault caresses her with the knife.

JAMES
Yeah. She tore the freezer door right off the

NORMA
Was she mad about something?
JAMES
No. She was happy.
The front door opens. TOJAMURA enters. Norma freezes. Tojamura nods.
NORMA
Dinner for one?
Tojamura, nods again. Norma shows him to a booth facing the front window and hands him
a newly calligraphic menu. Maddy hurries into the diner. Stops short when she sees James.
Tries to look past him looking for a waitress
JAMES
Hi.
MADDY
Hi.
(to the waitress)
Can I get a coffee to go?
JAMES
Seen Donna today?
MADDY
No, sorry. You?
JAMES
No. What's with the coffee?
MADDY
Coffee? It's for Uncle Leland.

Where are you going?
MADDY
Home. Bye, James.
Maddy leaves. James probingly watches. Waits. Then gets up and follows her out. Norma
and Hank exit from the kitchen, Norm carrying a plate of food. She points out Tojamura to
Hank.
NORMA
Louise said he checked into the Great Northern under
the name of Tojamura. This must be the food critic.
HANK
Does he have ponytail?
(Norma nods "yes")
I think he's been here already.
NORMA
What? When?
HANK
Let me handle this.
Hank takes the plate from Norma, moves towards Tojamura carrying the sliced turkey and
mashed potatoes smothered with gravy. Norma looks on anxiously from the back of the
room. Hank glides up and slides the plate through the air, holding it for an instant under
Tojamura's.
HANK
Our specialty.
He then shoves the back of the Asian's head forward, ramming his face into the gravy
mountain of mashed potatoes. Hank drops the plate on the table, slaps his palms clean in selfsatisfaction, and looks back at a stunned Norma.
HANK (CONTINUED)
This guy's no critic, he's a ...
Tojamura's mud-and-cloud face rises. Hank glances down. Realizes. Wrong Asian. He looks
back at Norma's Face of Death.

The last half hour before closing up. ANDY BRENNAN concludes a bravura evening
manning the switchboard. His chest and surrounding area are covered with yellow post-it
notes.
ANDY
(into phone)
No, sir, I'm sure not the regular girl. She's gone to
Tacoma to visit her sister. There's supposed to be a
number for her written down here somewhere.
Andy begins to look for it, but that's not what the caller is concerned about. Andy listens to
him for a moment.
ANDY (CONTINUED)
Well, I'm certainly not a lawyer, sir, but my
interpretation of the law would be that if your
neighbor's cow has each of his four hoofs completely
on his property, but his head is stretched over into
your property and he's chewing up your ...
(listens)
Well, I'm certainly no veterinarian, but I think that
would kill the cow. Right. Okay. Bye.
Andy disconnects. A pause in the action brings him to his moment of truth. He takes out a
scribbled piece of paper. Exhales. Dials.
ANDY (CONTINUED)
(into phone)
Yeah, I'm calling for some test results. Doc
Hayward said I could just call you an ... what's it
for? It was for a ...

excitement. Andy turns to him.
ANDY
I'm a whole damned town.

27.  TRUMAN'S OFFICE
Cooper and Truman at Truman's desk, leaning over Cooper's floor plan of One-Eyed Jack's.
COOPER
This is what I saw at One-Eyed Jack's. Main bar
and greeting room. Offices here. Casino and
Get-acquainted Room.
HAWK enters. Cooper adroitly sweeps the map to the side, a move the deputy notices.
HAWK
The one-armed man's been staying at a motel on
Highway 9. No one's seen him for the last day, dayand-a-half. His room looks lived in. I found this.
Hawk empties a paper bag of SYRINGES and several VIALS OF LIQUID.
HAWK (CONTINUED)
Same drug, as before.
(taking a whiff of it)
Weird, deep smell.
COOPER
We're still waiting for Albert's analysis. Good
work, Hawk.
Hawk grabs a look at the plans. Truman dismisses Hawk's concern.
TRUMAN
See you in the morning, Hawk.
Hawk exits. Cooper breaks the floor plans back out.

Truman and Cooper sweep by Andy. After they go out Andy reviews his scrap of paper
containing the fertility information and notices for the first time the blotter upon which it sits.
Lucy's blotter, with a swarm of phone numbers, one of them distinctly circled. His eyes are
drawn to this fresh-looking track. He picks up the phone and dials. Two rings.

30.  HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Maddy sits behind the front bushes, coffee cup in hand, eyes fixed on Harold Smith's
bedroom window.

31.  HAROLD SMITH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Donna and Harold sit together as before, she on the chair, he behind the desk. Harold opens
the diary with quiet ceremony. Quietly, with muted intensity, he begins:
HAROLD
(as he writes)
Donna Hayward. Tuesday. March the seventh.
Second session.
Harold looks up at Donna, waits for her to begin. Donna pauses, tongue-tied, a little
embarrassed. She sips from her glass of wine, as if to seek inspiration. Harold offers a
comforting smile. And some unexpected humor:
HAROLD
(gentle prompting)
"Dear Diary ...
Donna smiles, shrugs.
HAROLD
Tell me a story.
DONNA
What kind?
HAROLD
Anything you like. It's a diary. Filled with loves
and hates.
(CONTINUED)
30.
#2.005
31. CONTINUED:
DONNA
(as it to decide upon the theme)
Loves.
HAROLD
Good.
A beat. Harold waits for her to begin. Takes a sip from his own glass of wine. Finally:
DONNA
Uhm ... "Dear Diary ..."
(to Harold)
This is from a long time ago. Is that okay?
(he nods assent)
All right. Uhm ... I'm thirteen years old. Fourteen
maybe. Me and Laura put on our tightest shortest
skirts. Too tight, but Laura talks me into it. And we
go to the roadhouse to meet boys.
Donna pauses. Harold watches her intently, writes as he listens. The room is suddenly very
quiet and still. Almost eerie. As Donna gains the confidence to remember:
DONNA
Their names are Josh, Rick, and Tim. About twenty
years old . A nd they're nice to us, they treat us like
we're older. Rick asks if we want to parry and Laura
says yes.
(beat)
There's a stream in the woods. It seems pale and
light out. The boys build a fire. I like Tim the
best. He isn't so full of loud jokes like the others.
(beat)
Rick gets out a bottle of vodka and Laura starts
drinking. I can't believe how much she drinks. She
hands it to me. I take a sip. It feels good.
(beat)
Laura starts to dance around the boys. Moving her
 hips back and forth. Rick starts to clap. But Tim
doesn't do anything. He just watches. Somehow that
makes me mad. So I say, "Let's go skinny-dipping."
(beat)

#2.005
31. CONTINUED:(2)
DONNA (continued)
We take off our clothes. I know the boys are
watching us. The water feels really warm. The boy's
legs are white and I can see them under the water.
When Laura starts to kiss Josh and Rick, I don't know
what to do. So I swim away. I think maybe I want
to run but I don't. Tim swims over to me. I let him
kiss me. And I let him touch me. Once.
(beat)
When we leave, and this is what I remember best, the
boys are really nice. They don't make fun or talk
down to us. And Tim ... Tim kisses my hand when
we say goodbye. Then he kisses me.
(beat)
I can still feel that kiss. His lips are warm and
sweet. My heart sort of jumps. He's talking to me
but I don't really hear him. Just the kiss.
(beat)
I never saw him again. It was the first time I ever
fell in love. But Laura ...
Donna exhales, a little overwhelmed. Tears shine in her dark eyes.
DONNA
That's all.
(embarrassed; re tears)
Sorry.
HAROLD
That was beautiful, Donna.
Harold closes the diary.

32.  HAROLD SMITH'S GREENHOUSE - NIGHT
START CLOSE on a cymbidium orchid. Pale yellow and red. Quite beautiful. Harold
Smith's voice is HEARD.
HAROLD'S VOICE
Most people imagine orchids growing in exotic
steamy jungles. But you can grow them anywhere
with the right kind of care. I mean it's all basically
water and light, isn't it? Here. Look.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Harold and Donna in the greenhouse. Artificial light. Rows of
potted orchids. Harold delicately holds an orchid in his palm.
DONNA
It's beautiful.
HAROLD
(a quiet obsession)
Humidity is paramount. The control of it, I mean.
Too much moisture is an invitation to disease.
(pointing to appropriate parts)
Three sepals, three petals bottom petal shaped
like a lip is called the labellum.
DONNA
The colors ...
HAROLD
(re labellum)
It's a landing platform, really. For pollinating
insects.
Donna's fingers touch the petal. Then brush against Harold's hand.
DONNA
It's sort of romantic.
Harold now takes Donna's hand into his own. She turns toward him. And they kiss with
greater intensity than before. Something akin to passion. A beat. Harold steps back from her.
HAROLD
(with vague apprehension)
Will you excuse me for a minute?
(CONTINUED)
33.
#2.005
32. CONTINUED:
DONNA
Sure.
Harold steps away into his bedroom. The SOUND of running water is HEARD. Donna
reaches into her purse, grabs the flashlight. And races toward the front window.

33.  HAROLD SMITH'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Maddy SEES the tiny window flashes. She rises up from behind the bushes and does an
eggshell walk toward the bungalow door.

34.  ONE-EYED JACK'S - NIGHT
Re-establish. Hank stands in the shadows, watches something in the near distance. He speaks
into a cellular telephone with quiet urgency.
HANK
(into phone)
Ben, we've got a problem. The drop at the merry-goround's not for two hours and Cooper's at One-Eyed
Jack's. And he's not alone.

35.  AROUND BACK - NIGHT
Up over a hillside ridge, a walkway runs just the back French doors. ANGLE ON a GUARD
on patrol. He hears a NOISE behind him and starts to reach for his gun, but there's suddenly
a strong yank on his arm. Truman stuffs a rubber ball into his mouth and almost
simultaneously slaps into handcuffs behind his back. Then from another pocket in his jacket,
he seals the ball in place with tape. Cooper inspects Truman's JACKET. A modified fishing
vest loaded with burglary tools. Cooper nods appreciatively. Gestures forward.
They approach the back door. Locked. Truman plants in odd piece of iron between the
French doors. Props it between the French doors, pushes the doors in and as they bounce
back out and OPEN.

36.  ONE-EYED JACK'S - NIGHT
Cooper and Truman enter atop a long, ill-lit stairway. They look about, alert, ready for
anything, then start down the stairs. Party sounds abound from the adjoining main rooms.
Cooper and Truman walk past the first hallway of noise, the casino, gliding by, trying to
make themselves invisible. As they approach the next level, a GIRL leads a CUSTOMER out
into the hall.

They, freeze against the wall: She looks up the stairs and happily prances right past them, a
little drunk, not seeing. Cooper and Truman exhale. They descend past this level toward the
darkness of the bottom floor.

37.  ONE-EYED JACK'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
Cooper and Truman move stealthily down the hallway. They near Blackie's office, a window,
their view limited by drooping red curtains. Truman peers inside. Signals "two" occupants to
Cooper. Cooper gestures a reply. Stay put. I'll circle in the other direction. HOLD ON
Truman for a beat, as he scoots closer, tries to get a better look inside.

38.  ONE-EYED JACK'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
Cooper moves quietly down the hall, looking left and right. Suddenly a woman appears. It's
Nancy, Blackie's sister. Cooper doesn't hesitate.
COOPER
(coldly determined)
Please take me to Audrey Horne. Now.
NANCY
(figuring her options)
I don't think she's available.
Cooper takes out his pistol.
COOPER
Let's double check.
Cooper takes Nancy by the arm. Allows her to lead him forward.

39.  BLACKIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
START CLOSE on a video monitor showing Cooper playing blackjack. ANOTHER ANGLE
reveals Jean Renault, glancing at the screen from time to time. He holds a small spoon in one
hand, a lighter in the other. He fixing a hot shot for Audrey. Blackie watches, waits.
BLACKIE
(re hot shot)
Not such a bad way to go. All things considered.

BLACKIE
Nancy's with her.

What does she do for you that I can't?
RENAULT

You do all right.
Renault loads the syringe with a practiced hand. Everything proceeds in business-like fashion.
Blackie steps a little closer, eyes on the drugs that remain.

40.  ONE-EYED JACK'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
Truman leans against the wall, having witnessed much of the latter. He looks down the
hallway for Cooper, some sign. But sees and hear nothing. Truman scoots a little closer to the
office door. Considers his next move.

41.  ONE-EYED JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Cooper and Nancy enter the bedroom. Cooper sees Audrey, dazed, bound up on the bed.
He gives Nancy a quick stare: of controlled rage. She equivocates:
NANCY
It's not my idea, okay? We're nothin' but meat on a
hook to these people.
(imploring)
I'll do whatever I can to help. Serious.
Cooper's not listening. He kneels at Audrey's side.
COOPER
Audrey. Can you hear me?
AUDREY
(slipping in and out)
Mmmmm ... Who ... ? ... My ... my prayers ...

#2.005
41. CONTINUED:
COOPER
(quiet, intense)
Audrey, I'm going to take you out of here now.
Cooper hears the sound of brushing silk. He reacts, turns in time to SEE Nancy take a stiletto
out of her boot. Her hand sweeps forward, blade flashing. Cooper shifts to avoid. But the
steel catches his arm, rips and tears. Cooper grabs Nancy's wrist with his free hand, wrenches
the knife from her grasp, sends her sprawling with a punch to the jaw. She's out cold.
Cooper retrieves the knife, cuts Audrey's ropes. He bundles her in the top blanket, takes
Audrey into his arms. Cooper moves as quickly as is possible. He knows he is running out of
time.

42. / BLACKIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Truman watches as Renault places the loaded syringe in his pocket Steps toward the door.
Blackie follows, now steps in his path. She smirks, sidles into Renault's arms. A deep kiss.
Truman crouches by the doorway, reaches for his pistol. Ready for action. Just then: the
unmistakable WHISTLE of Renault's spring-loaded KNIFE.
Blackie gasps, sags. Feels the blade enter her torso. Renault removes the knife, releases her.
Blackie falls dead from his embrace to the floor.
Truman reacts with shock. pistol in hand, he stands, turns toward the office.
Inside the office, Renault spots Truman. He reaches for a pistol, FIRES. Truman ducks for
cover. Renault's bullet strikes a window, glass shatters, flies. Truman marine crawls to a
better vantage po He rolls, pistol aimed, ready to fire, but Renault is GONE.

43.  ONE-EYED JACK'S -CORRIDOR
Cooper hurries down the corridor, Audrey in his arms. Truman meets him from the opposite
direction. Neither has time for conversation. They turn toward the nearest exit. Truman leads
the way. Suddenly: another BODYGUARD appears between them and the exit. He holds a
gun in his hands. Means to use it.
BODYGUARD
Drop the gun.
Truman deliberately places his gun on the floor. Cooper holds Audrey tightly in his arms,
says nothing. The bodyguard's gun cocks. Then a hollow drum-like SOUND. Truman turns
to see the guard fall forward, a bowie knife lodged deep between his scapulas. Halfway up
the stairs is Hawk.
HAWK
Good thing you guys can't keep a secret.
Cooper, Truman, and Hawk dart up the stairs.

44.  THE HIGH RIDGE - NIGHT
Cooper, Truman, and Hawk are VIEWED from a HIGH ANGLE. Racing with Audrey into
the shadows.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals this to be Hank's POV. He speaks into the cellular phone:
HANK
(into phone)
There's been gun fire. Cooper and Truman are
leaving with your daughter .....
A GUN moves into FRAME, pointed at Hank's head. Hank hangs up without another word.
SHOT EXPANDS to show Jean Renault holding the pistol.
Hank's hands slowly go up. Renault reaches over into Hank's coat pocket and pulls out a
wallet. Opens it. He reacts with surprise.
INSERT - WALLET
Darryl Lodwick's state prosecutor's identification is prominently displayed.

hidden bookcase.

46.  GREENHOUSE - NIGHT
Donna peers out the greenhouse window into the living room. Follows Maddy's progress.
Suddenly: Harold Smith returns, takes her by surprise. Donna reacts with a start.
DONNA
Hi.
HAROLD
(suspicious; eye on window)
Is something wrong?
Harold turns toward the window. Donna moves to intercept.
DONNA
No. You scared me a little that's all. I ...
Harold pulls free from her grasp, steps to the window. Donna nearly pleads.
DONNA
Tell me about the orchids. This one ...
Too late. Harold stalks forward.

47.  HAROLD SMITH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Maddy excitedly reaches for the diary with Laura's name embossed upon it. She pulls it out
too quickly knocking several books to the floor. Maddy turns toward the greenhouse
window, GASPS.
Harold Smith stands on the other side of the glass, face distorted, now staring at her with
anger.

rips free from her grasp, shoves her toward Maddy and the hidden books.
Maddy and Donna stand together, breathless, afraid. Harold Smith pauses, just stares at them
for a beat Feels the black weight of their betrayal. Then, quietly, almost a whisper, he speaks:
HAROLD
Are you looking for secrets? Is that it? Maybe I can
give you one. Do you want to know what the
ultimate secret is? Laura did.
(eyes flaring)
The secret of knowing who killed you.
Maddy screams.

COOPER
Diane, it's 6:42 a.m., a bit of a late start, due to a
persisting soreness in the rib area ...
(rises tentatively)
An ache that feels as if a wing were cut away in my
sleep.
(approaching)
Diane, a strange dream to report: I dreamt I was
eating a large, tasteless gumdrop. I soon awoke to
realize I was aggressively munching on one of my
Air-Pillow Silicon Ear Plugs. Hence the
tastelessness. I suspect some unexpressed feeling of
aggression is responsible.
(drops to crouch)
Diane, rather than equilibrate through the use of my
gravity boots, which could induce further rib
separation, this morning I'm going to attempt a
headstand.

I'm now upside down, my mind becoming porous,
the day tasks coming into focus, objects growing
clearer ...
Looking out in the darkness of the stained wood floor, which now looks to us like the ceiling.
Cooper sees a white envelope under, or rather over, the bed. Cooper unfurls and reaches for

A hospital bed has replaced the living room sofa. In a wheelchair beside the bed sits BOBBY
BRIGGS, allowing the medical supplies salesman, TIM PINKLE, to demonstrate a lifting
apparatus. Pinkle is a pasty, perspiration-prone man with an affectation of high duty.
SHELLY JOHNSON stands a step removed, looking on.
PINKLE
The Port-O-Patient will allow you to fluently
transport the unfortunate Mr. Johnson, allowing him
even to sit outside and experience what he can of
nature.
BOBBY
(resolutely)
Mr. Pinkle, I want my cousin Leo to have the fullest
possible experience of life.
PINKLE
That's what we're here for. Let's take
Pinkle inspects the electrical engine that, along with the rest of the host, looks to be quite
antiquated. Bobby sits in the loose body sling connected to an overhead bar by two sagging
crossing chains, giving this crane-like device the look of a silvery praying mantis.
SHELLY
Mr. Pinkle are you going to put in a ramp.
PINKLE
Ah... sure. I've got some plywood, uh, pinewood
ramp boards I'll install outside. Absolutely.
Pinkle finds the switch to start the engine.
PINKLE (CONT'D)
Okay, here we go.
He flips the switch. Nothing happens.
PINKLE (CONT'D)
That's a new wrinkle. It was working the other day.
Pinkle fiddles with the cord to the socket. Nothing. Suddenly the engine starts. The bar jerks

tossed back down. Then the machine stops. Flashing Pinkle a homicidal look, Bobby fights his
way out of the chains, sling, and chair.

BOBBY
How about getting Mr. Pinkle a cold drink?
As Shelly leaves, Bobby pulls Pinkle aside by the back of his neck.
BOBBY
That thing's a death trap, Pinkle. I told you we have
to keep him alive.
PINKLE
Insurance companies don't exactly pay off like the
slots. After both our cuts, it was either this or a firstrate wheelbarrow.
Shelly returns. Pinkle takes the soda and dives into tinkering with the machine.
SHELLY
(needs a private word)
Bobby?
(beat)
I've got to meet Leo's lawyer.
BOBBY
(taking her into the kitchen)
The hearing's today, right?
PINKLE (O.S.)
Be just another second, folks.
SHELLY
Bobby, are we okay?
His response is a passionate stare. She smolders back. With Pinkle about, they can do no
more than look and want. But outside ... Bobby takes her hand.
BOBBY
Come on, he can let himself out.
They exit. Pinkle, studies the non-working hoist. After a moment he climbs up into the sling.
Testing. He shouts back to Bobby.
PINKLE (CONT'D)
Probably a short in the switch.
Pinkle reaches down and hits the switch a couple of time; finally, the bar lifts, the chains
tighten and the salesman rises.
PINKLE (CONT'D)
There we go ...

9.  ROADHOUSE - DAY
The entry doors have been closed, the tables pushed against the front wall. Two rows of
chairs face a long, solid judge's table at the back of the room. Andy escorts Leland past
Cooper and Truman, standing near the door, to a defendant's table in the front row. The
prosecutor's table sits alongside, SARAH PALMER and MADDY FERGUSON sit behind
Leland in the second row, along with a few habitual COURT WITNESSES. Leland takes
Sarah's hand for a moment.
The small group stands as JUDGE CLINTON STERNWOOD, all in shining black robes,
strides expansively into the room; a rich, magisterial presence and powerful, uncluttered
eyes. His trailed by SID, his bailiff. Appraising the prosecutorless situation, Sternwood stops
beside Cooper and Truman.
STERNWOOD
Morning. Where's Lodwick the prosecutor?
TRUMAN
Hasn't shown.
STERNWOOD
(nods; there'll be a delay)
Took a long constitutional this morning. The path
leading down to the waterfall. A fine, invigorating
mist in the air. There was a twelve-point buck
drinking from the pool; he saw me but didn't bolt.
Time stood still. I In the presence of the eternal, I

BEN HORNE has entered, late, immediately makes his way to the power in the room.
STERNWOOD
Benjamin.
HORNE
Your Honor, a pleasure, sorry I missed you last night.
STERNWOOD
Your dining room served a wild boar with a cherry
sauce that I haven't yet found the words to describe.
(to Cooper)
I've been around the Great Northern since the dawn
of man. Hammered my way through law school
there.
HORNE
Clinton worked construction for my father. In my
boyhood memory he built half the hotel singlehandedly.
COOPER
There's a door near my room, opening out to the
back, that's like nothing I've ever seen. Two panel
oak, all joined with tongues, tenons, and dowels.
Not a nail or a screw in it.
STERNWOOD
Thank you. I remember that door. Dryclamped and
lying in the sun. Beautiful piece of work -
DARRYL LODWICK, the state prosecutor, arrives, apologetically approaching Sternwood.
LODWICK
Sorry, I had a bit of trouble. Lost my wallet.
STERNWOOD

Enter the State.

10.  ROADHOUSE - DAY
Sitting alone and imposing at his long table, Sternwood GAVELS and commences.
STERNWOOD
Mr. Palmer has pleaded not guilty to the charge of
murder in the first degree. Defense has requested
bail. This is a pretrial hearing to determine if that
bail will be granted. Mr. Prosecutor ...
LODWICK
We, the people of the state of Washington, move that
the defendant be denied bail on the basis of: 1)the
great seriousness of the crime for which he's been
accused; 2) the apparently premeditated nature of
this act; and 3) the oft-witnessed instability of Mr.
Palmer during the period following the death of his
daughter.
All eyes are on Leland as Lodwick sits.
STERNWOOD
Sheriff Truman will speak for the defense.
TRUMAN
Mr. Palmer is a well-known, respected member of
this community, with a good professional reputation
and established roots. And beyond that ... I'd like
to say that none of us can really know what it's like to
lose a seventeen year-old daughter the way he did.
What that might do to any one of us ...
(suddenly self-conscious)
That's all.
Sternwood deliberates. Truman takes his seat beside Andy, who is glancing up and over a
row up at Leland's partial profile. Truman glances down at the sketchpad in Andy's lap and
sees ...
Andy's sketch of Leland, from the same angle as just seen by Truman: a profile favoring the
back left side of the head.
Andy notices Truman's attention.
ANDY
I thought I might sell this to the Gazette. They
seem to like courtroom sketches.
TRUMAN
You might try for a little more of his face. Just a
suggestion.

ANDY
Good. Thanks, Sheriff.
Sternwood gavels.
STERNWOOD
On the basis of his high standing in the community,
the pristine nature of his public and private
reputation and his evident respect for the letter of the
law, which is well known to me ... defendant is
released on his own recognizance. Leland, as you
know, I'll require you to remain in town, making
your whereabouts known to the Sheriff on a regular
basis. Sid, check the calendar. We'll set the date for
Mr. Palmer's trial.
Reactions all round: for Leland, a shred of dignity retained.

Harold undoes the secret bookshelf. Donna tries not to make an obvious point of observing.
He tries to casually conceal the fact he's concealing how the locking mechanism works. He
takes out a fresh ledger, lays Laura's diary on the desk beside him, makes a show of taking
out an expensive fountain pen and cracks open the new book.
HAROLD

Donna ... Hayward.
(smiles, simply)

DONNA
Alright. I'm from Twin Peaks. That is I was born
here. My father delivered me. He's a doctor.
Where are you from?
HAROLD
I grew up in Boston. Actually, I grew up in books.
DONNA
There are things you can't get from books.
HAROLD
There are things you can't get anywhere. But we
dream they can be found in other people. Continue.
Donna stands, comes over to the desk coquettishly along its edge.

HAROLD
Give that back to me, please.
DONNA
Why don't you come out with me? Come on.
What's there to be afraid of?
She backs through the open doorway. He bolts forward; but suddenly it's as if she's backed
over a cliff. His face flushes at the flood of daylight. A trembling ignites in his fingers.
HAROLD
Oh God ... oh God ...
DONNA
Harold?
He gets down on the ground, hyperventilating, looking almost paralyzed.
DONNA (CONTINUED).
Harold?
His breathing locks. She hurries to him, kneels down, half-props him against her chest, he
grasps at her, trying to breathe again.
DONNA
It's all right. It's all right. I'm so sorry.
HAROLD
I just ... I just got too close.
DONNA

As his panic fades, seeking and finding permission in her eyes, he kisses her tenderly. They

FADE IN:
13.  ROADHOUSE - DAY
Leo Johnson competency hearing. Judge Sternwood is holding court, facing Prosecutor
Lodwick and JACK RACINE, a sardonic defense attorney representing Leo Johnson.
We begin CLOSE ON a blown-up photograph of Leo Johnson, before and after injury and a
diagram on an easel Racine is showing to the judge and closeby gallery area, occupied by
Cooper, Truman, and Shelly Johnson. The diagram is of two EEG waves, one large and
varied, the other flat and undisclosing.
RACINE
You can see by these EEG's, the one above, which is
actually of my own head and intended to show
normal brain activity . The line below is of Mr.
Johnson and shows minimal activity. The previously
submitted medical report states that Mr. Johnson has
suffered diffuse brain damage. He isn't currently
even capable of taking the standard CST
competency tests. We therefore submit that trying
this individual would constitute a mockery of the
justice system, a proceeding the unfortunate young
man wold not even faintly comprehend.
Racine withdraws.
STERNWOOD
Mr. Prosecutor.
Lodwick stands, takes a posturing step toward an almost empty gallery, and accidentally
makes eye contact with Shelly Johnson before folding back toward the judge.
LODWICK
I know that Leo Johnson isn't in very good shape. On
the surface, it might seem ridiculous to make him
stand trial. But a trial doesn't just punish a
wrongdoer; it also brings a feeling of justice and
retribution to a community. Among the various
crimes he's suspected of, the murder of Laura Palmer
is the sort that can wound an entire town.

LODWICK (continued)
For there to be even a shred of feeling that the
perpetrator of this terrible crime got away with it -
(Sternwood starts to wave him off)
- this simply cannot be. As long as Leo Johnson
carries a breath, he is as eminently deserving of a
trial as this community is of a resolution -
STERNWOOD
All right, have a seat, Mr. Lodwick. You fellas catch
your breath, I'm going to need to deliberate.
(rises)
Mr. Cooper, Sheriff Truman if I could have the
pleasure of your company ...
Sternwood waves them over to join him at the bar.
STERNWOOD (CONT'D)
Sid, how about fixing me up a Black Yukon on Sucker
Punch?
Sid contentedly goes to work behind the bar, concocting an elaborate drink. Cooper and
Truman flank Sternwood at the bar.
STERNWOOD (CONT'D)
Lodwick really planted his feet and looked it in the
eye. I didn't think he'd press on the murder charge.
Is Leo Johnson your man?
COOPER
No, sir, I don't believe he is.
STERNWOOD
Harry, what's the town's temperature? Do they want
a trial or a lynching?
TRUMAN
They want the right man brought to justice.
STERNWOOD
Then they don't a need a circus. This poor bastard
seems to be a head of cabbage. Thoughts, Cooper?
COOPER
I feel the right man will eventually be apprehended.

When medically possible, he may be sent home.
Harry, maybe you'd like to tell the little lady
yourself.
Truman nods gratefully, moves to Shelly.
STERNWOOD (CONT'D)
How long you been here, Cooper?
COOPER
Close to two weeks, sir.
STERNWOOD
I'll advise you to keep your eye on the woods. The
woods are wondrous here. But strange.
Sternwood drinks his drink, his eye on some distant, sinister horizon. Truman kneels down
beside Shelly, who, distracted, doesn't notice him at first.
TRUMAN
Shelly? They're not going to try him.

Truman and Cooper sweep by Andy. After they go out Andy reviews his scrap of paper
containing the fertility information and notices for the first time the blotter upon which it sits.
Lucy's blotter, with a swarm of phone numbers, one of them distinctly circled. His eyes are
drawn to this fresh-looking track. He picks up the phone and dials. Two rings.

30.  HAROLD SMITH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Maddy sits behind the front bushes, coffee cup in hand, eyes fixed on Harold Smith's
bedroom window.

31.  HAROLD SMITH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Donna and Harold sit together as before, she on the chair, he behind the desk. Harold opens
the diary with quiet ceremony. Quietly, with muted intensity, he begins:
HAROLD
(as he writes)
Donna Hayward. Tuesday. March the seventh.
Second session.
Harold looks up at Donna, waits for her to begin. Donna pauses, tongue-tied, a little
embarrassed. She sips from her glass of wine, as if to seek inspiration. Harold offers a
comforting smile. And some unexpected humor:
HAROLD
(gentle prompting)
"Dear Diary ...
Donna smiles, shrugs.
HAROLD
Tell me a story.
DONNA
What kind?
HAROLD
Anything you like. It's a diary. Filled with loves
and hates.
(CONTINUED)

#2.005
31. CONTINUED:
DONNA
(as it to decide upon the theme)
Loves.
HAROLD
Good.
A beat. Harold waits for her to begin. Takes a sip from his own glass of wine. Finally:
DONNA
Uhm ... "Dear Diary ..."
(to Harold)
This is from a long time ago. Is that okay?
(he nods assent)
All right. Uhm ... I'm thirteen years old. Fourteen
maybe. Me and Laura put on our tightest shortest
skirts. Too tight, but Laura talks me into it. And we
go to the roadhouse to meet boys.
Donna pauses. Harold watches her intently, writes as he listens. The room is suddenly very
quiet and still. Almost eerie. As Donna gains the confidence to remember:
DONNA
Their names are Josh, Rick, and Tim. About twenty
years old . A nd they're nice to us, they treat us like
we're older. Rick asks if we want to parry and Laura
says yes.
(beat)
There's a stream in the woods. It seems pale and
light out. The boys build a fire. I like Tim the
best. He isn't so full of loud jokes like the others.
(beat)
Rick gets out a bottle of vodka and Laura starts
drinking. I can't believe how much she drinks. She
hands it to me. I take a sip. It feels good.
(beat)
Laura starts to dance around the boys. Moving her
 hips back and forth. Rick starts to clap. But Tim
doesn't do anything. He just watches. Somehow that
makes me mad. So I say, "Let's go skinny-dipping."
(beat)

31. CONTINUED:(2)
DONNA (continued)
We take off our clothes. I know the boys are
watching us. The water feels really warm. The boy's
legs are white and I can see them under the water.
When Laura starts to kiss Josh and Rick, I don't know
what to do. So I swim away. I think maybe I want
to run but I don't. Tim swims over to me. I let him
kiss me. And I let him touch me. Once.
(beat)
When we leave, and this is what I remember best, the
boys are really nice. They don't make fun or talk
down to us. And Tim ... Tim kisses my hand when
we say goodbye. Then he kisses me.
(beat)
I can still feel that kiss. His lips are warm and
sweet. My heart sort of jumps. He's talking to me
but I don't really hear him. Just the kiss.
(beat)
I never saw him again. It was the first time I ever
fell in love. But Laura ...
Donna exhales, a little overwhelmed. Tears shine in her dark eyes.
DONNA
That's all.
(embarrassed; re tears)
Sorry.
HAROLD
That was beautiful, Donna.
Harold closes the diary.

32.  HAROLD SMITH'S GREENHOUSE - NIGHT
START CLOSE on a cymbidium orchid. Pale yellow and red. Quite beautiful. Harold
Smith's voice is HEARD.
HAROLD'S VOICE
Most people imagine orchids growing in exotic
steamy jungles. But you can grow them anywhere
with the right kind of care. I mean it's all basically
water and light, isn't it? Here. Look.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Harold and Donna in the greenhouse. Artificial light. Rows of
potted orchids. Harold delicately holds an orchid in his palm.
DONNA
It's beautiful.
HAROLD
(a quiet obsession)
Humidity is paramount. The control of it, I mean.
Too much moisture is an invitation to disease.
(pointing to appropriate parts)
Three sepals, three petals bottom petal shaped
like a lip is called the labellum.
DONNA
The colors ...
HAROLD
(re labellum)
It's a landing platform, really. For pollinating
insects.
Donna's fingers touch the petal. Then brush against Harold's hand.
DONNA
It's sort of romantic.
Harold now takes Donna's hand into his own. She turns toward him. And they kiss with
greater intensity than before. Something akin to passion. A beat. Harold steps back from her.
HAROLD
(with vague apprehension)
Will you excuse me for a minute?
(CONTINUED)

#2.005

DONNA
Sure.
Harold steps away into his bedroom. The SOUND of running water is HEARD. Donna
reaches into her purse, grabs the flashlight. And races toward the front window.

33.  HAROLD SMITH'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Maddy SEES the tiny window flashes. She rises up from behind the bushes and does an
eggshell walk toward the bungalow door.

34.  ONE-EYED JACK'S - NIGHT
Re-establish. Hank stands in the shadows, watches something in the near distance. He speaks
into a cellular telephone with quiet urgency.
HANK
(into phone)
Ben, we've got a problem. The drop at the merry-goround's not for two hours and Cooper's at One-Eyed
Jack's. And he's not alone.

35.  AROUND BACK - NIGHT
Up over a hillside ridge, a walkway runs just the back French doors. ANGLE ON a GUARD
on patrol. He hears a NOISE behind him and starts to reach for his gun, but there's suddenly
a strong yank on his arm. Truman stuffs a rubber ball into his mouth and almost
simultaneously slaps into handcuffs behind his back. Then from another pocket in his jacket,
he seals the ball in place with tape. Cooper inspects Truman's JACKET. A modified fishing
vest loaded with burglary tools. Cooper nods appreciatively. Gestures forward.
They approach the back door. Locked. Truman plants in odd piece of iron between the
French doors. Props it between the French doors, pushes the doors in and as they bounce
back out and OPEN.

36.  ONE-EYED JACK'S - NIGHT
Cooper and Truman enter atop a long, ill-lit stairway. They look about, alert, ready for
anything, then start down the stairs. Party sounds abound from the adjoining main rooms.
Cooper and Truman walk past the first hallway of noise, the casino, gliding by, trying to
make themselves invisible. As they approach the next level, a GIRL leads a CUSTOMER out
into the hall.

They, freeze against the wall: She looks up the stairs and happily prances right past them, a
little drunk, not seeing. Cooper and Truman exhale. They descend past this level toward the
darkness of the bottom floor.

37.  ONE-EYED JACK'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
Cooper and Truman move stealthily down the hallway. They near Blackie's office, a window,
their view limited by drooping red curtains. Truman peers inside. Signals "two" occupants to
Cooper. Cooper gestures a reply. Stay put. I'll circle in the other direction. HOLD ON
Truman for a beat, as he scoots closer, tries to get a better look inside.

38.  ONE-EYED JACK'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
Cooper moves quietly down the hall, looking left and right. Suddenly a woman appears. It's
Nancy, Blackie's sister. Cooper doesn't hesitate.
COOPER
(coldly determined)
Please take me to Audrey Horne. Now.
NANCY
(figuring her options)
I don't think she's available.
Cooper takes out his pistol.
COOPER
Let's double check.
Cooper takes Nancy by the arm. Allows her to lead him forward.

39.  BLACKIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
START CLOSE on a video monitor showing Cooper playing blackjack. ANOTHER ANGLE
reveals Jean Renault, glancing at the screen from time to time. He holds a small spoon in one
hand, a lighter in the other. He fixing a hot shot for Audrey. Blackie watches, waits.
BLACKIE
(re hot shot)
Not such a bad way to go. All things considered.

BLACKIE
Nancy's with her.
(jealousy)
What does she do for you that I can't?
RENAULT
(quiet smile)
You do all right.
Renault loads the syringe with a practiced hand. Everything proceeds in business-like fashion.
Blackie steps a little closer, eyes on the drugs that remain.

40.  ONE-EYED JACK'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
Truman leans against the wall, having witnessed much of the latter. He looks down the
hallway for Cooper, some sign. But sees and hear nothing. Truman scoots a little closer to the
office door. Considers his next move.

41.  ONE-EYED JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Cooper and Nancy enter the bedroom. Cooper sees Audrey, dazed, bound up on the bed.
He gives Nancy a quick stare: of controlled rage. She equivocates:
NANCY
It's not my idea, okay? We're nothin' but meat on a
hook to these people.
(imploring)
I'll do whatever I can to help. Serious.
Cooper's not listening. He kneels at Audrey's side.
COOPER
Audrey. Can you hear me?
AUDREY
(slipping in and out)
Mmmmm ... Who ... ? ... My ... my prayers ...
(CONTINUED)
36.
#2.005
41. CONTINUED:
COOPER
(quiet, intense)
Audrey, I'm going to take you out of here now.
Cooper hears the sound of brushing silk. He reacts, turns in time to SEE Nancy take a stiletto
out of her boot. Her hand sweeps forward, blade flashing. Cooper shifts to avoid. But the
steel catches his arm, rips and tears. Cooper grabs Nancy's wrist with his free hand, wrenches
the knife from her grasp, sends her sprawling with a punch to the jaw. She's out cold.
Cooper retrieves the knife, cuts Audrey's ropes. He bundles her in the top blanket, takes
Audrey into his arms. Cooper moves as quickly as is possible. He knows he is running out of
time.

42. / BLACKIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Truman watches as Renault places the loaded syringe in his pocket Steps toward the door.
Blackie follows, now steps in his path. She smirks, sidles into Renault's arms. A deep kiss.
Truman crouches by the doorway, reaches for his pistol. Ready for action. Just then: the
unmistakable WHISTLE of Renault's spring-loaded KNIFE.
Blackie gasps, sags. Feels the blade enter her torso. Renault removes the knife, releases her.
Blackie falls dead from his embrace to the floor.
Truman reacts with shock. pistol in hand, he stands, turns toward the office.
Inside the office, Renault spots Truman. He reaches for a pistol, FIRES. Truman ducks for
cover. Renault's bullet strikes a window, glass shatters, flies. Truman marine crawls to a
better vantage po He rolls, pistol aimed, ready to fire, but Renault is GONE.

43.  ONE-EYED JACK'S -CORRIDOR
Cooper hurries down the corridor, Audrey in his arms. Truman meets him from the opposite
direction. Neither has time for conversation. They turn toward the nearest exit. Truman leads
the way. Suddenly: another BODYGUARD appears between them and the exit. He holds a
gun in his hands. Means to use it.
BODYGUARD
Drop the gun.
Truman deliberately places his gun on the floor. Cooper holds Audrey tightly in his arms,
says nothing. The bodyguard's gun cocks. Then a hollow drum-like SOUND. Truman turns
to see the guard fall forward, a bowie knife lodged deep between his scapulas. Halfway up
the stairs is Hawk.
HAWK
Good thing you guys can't keep a secret.
Cooper, Truman, and Hawk dart up the stairs.

44.  THE HIGH RIDGE - NIGHT
Cooper, Truman, and Hawk are VIEWED from a HIGH ANGLE. Racing with Audrey into
the shadows.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals this to be Hank's POV. He speaks into the cellular phone:
HANK
(into phone)
There's been gun fire. Cooper and Truman are
leaving with your daughter .....
A GUN moves into FRAME, pointed at Hank's head. Hank hangs up without another word.
SHOT EXPANDS to show Jean Renault holding the pistol.
Hank's hands slowly go up. Renault reaches over into Hank's coat pocket and pulls out a
wallet. Opens it. He reacts with surprise.
INSERT - WALLET
Darryl Lodwick's state prosecutor's identification is prominently displayed.

Maddy stands against the bookcase, looking for the button Donna described. She runs her
hand along a panel, then down it's side. A button! The panels open. Maddy looks in at the
hidden bookcase.

46.  GREENHOUSE - NIGHT
Donna peers out the greenhouse window into the living room. Follows Maddy's progress.
Suddenly: Harold Smith returns, takes her by surprise. Donna reacts with a start.
DONNA
Hi.
HAROLD
(suspicious; eye on window)
Is something wrong?
Harold turns toward the window. Donna moves to intercept.
DONNA
No. You scared me a little that's all. I ...
Harold pulls free from her grasp, steps to the window. Donna nearly pleads.
DONNA
Tell me about the orchids. This one ...
Too late. Harold stalks forward.

47.  HAROLD SMITH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Maddy excitedly reaches for the diary with Laura's name embossed upon it. She pulls it out
too quickly knocking several books to the floor. Maddy turns toward the greenhouse
window, GASPS.
Harold Smith stands on the other side of the glass, face distorted, now staring at her with
anger.

himself between her and the door, armed with the metal tool. Donna reaches for his arm, he
rips free from her grasp, shoves her toward Maddy and the hidden books.
Maddy and Donna stand together, breathless, afraid. Harold Smith pauses, just stares at them
for a beat Feels the black weight of their betrayal. Then, quietly, almost a whisper, he speaks:
HAROLD
Are you looking for secrets? Is that it? Maybe I can
give you one. Do you want to know what the
ultimate secret is? Laura did.
(eyes flaring)
The secret of knowing who killed you.
Maddy screams.

COOPER sits on the edge of the bed in his boxer shorts. Flips on his tape recorder.
COOPER
Diane, it's 6:42 a.m., a bit of a late start, due to a
persisting soreness in the rib area ...
(rises tentatively)
An ache that feels as if a wing were cut away in my
sleep.
(approaching)
Diane, a strange dream to report: I dreamt I was
eating a large, tasteless gumdrop. I soon awoke to
realize I was aggressively munching on one of my
Air-Pillow Silicon Ear Plugs. Hence the
tastelessness. I suspect some unexpressed feeling of
aggression is responsible.
(drops to crouch)
Diane, rather than equilibrate through the use of my
gravity boots, which could induce further rib
separation, this morning I'm going to attempt a
headstand.
(rolls up onto the wall)
I'm now upside down, my mind becoming porous,
the day tasks coming into focus, objects growing
clearer ...
Looking out in the darkness of the stained wood floor, which now looks to us like the ceiling.
Cooper sees a white envelope under, or rather over, the bed. Cooper unfurls and reaches for
it.
COOPER

"My special agent ..."

HAWK

LUCY
Excuse me, Sheriff, I'm sorry to interrupt, but
Sheriff, I just wanted to say goodbye because as you
know, I'm going down to Tacoma for two days to
visit my sister, Gwen and her husband, Larry, who
had a baby last week, you remember, it was a boy
and as soon as the Can Do temp girl gets here I'll

LUCY
No, she should have been here by now, I can wait and
at least show her ... show her ...
TRUMAN

With silent gratitude, she picks up her bag and exits ahead of Hawk. Cooper then enters,
eyes cool, intently ablaze. Both he and Truman instinctively step toward an empty corridor.

7.  LEO JOHNSON'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
A hospital bed has replaced the living room sofa. In a wheelchair beside the bed sits BOBBY
BRIGGS, allowing the medical supplies salesman, TIM PINKLE, to demonstrate a lifting
apparatus. Pinkle is a pasty, perspiration-prone man with an affectation of high duty.
SHELLY JOHNSON stands a step removed, looking on.
PINKLE
The Port-O-Patient will allow you to fluently
transport the unfortunate Mr. Johnson, allowing him
even to sit outside and experience what he can of
nature.
BOBBY
(resolutely)
Mr. Pinkle, I want my cousin Leo to have the fullest
possible experience of life.
PINKLE
That's what we're here for. Let's take
Pinkle inspects the electrical engine that, along with the rest of the host, looks to be quite
antiquated. Bobby sits in the loose body sling connected to an overhead bar by two sagging
crossing chains, giving this crane-like device the look of a silvery praying mantis.
SHELLY
Mr. Pinkle are you going to put in a ramp.
PINKLE
Ah... sure. I've got some plywood, uh, pinewood
ramp boards I'll install outside. Absolutely.
Pinkle finds the switch to start the engine.
PINKLE (CONT'D)
Okay, here we go.
He flips the switch. Nothing happens.
PINKLE (CONT'D)
That's a new wrinkle. It was working the other day.
Pinkle fiddles with the cord to the socket. Nothing. Suddenly the engine starts. The bar jerks
up and the chains snap tight across a frightened Bobby, who's yanked up from his seat and
tossed back down. Then the machine stops. Flashing Pinkle a homicidal look, Bobby fights his
way out of the chains, sling, and chair.
SHELLY
Bobby, 'you alright?

BOBBY
How about getting Mr. Pinkle a cold drink?
As Shelly leaves, Bobby pulls Pinkle aside by the back of his neck.
BOBBY
That thing's a death trap, Pinkle. I told you we have
to keep him alive.
PINKLE
Insurance companies don't exactly pay off like the
slots. After both our cuts, it was either this or a firstrate wheelbarrow.
Shelly returns. Pinkle takes the soda and dives into tinkering with the machine.
SHELLY

Bobby?

I've got to meet Leo's lawyer.
BOBBY
(taking her into the kitchen)
The hearing's today, right?
PINKLE (O.S.)
Be just another second, folks.
SHELLY
Bobby, are we okay?
His response is a passionate stare. She smolders back. With Pinkle about, they can do no
more than look and want. But outside ... Bobby takes her hand.
BOBBY
Come on, he can let himself out.
They exit. Pinkle, studies the non-working hoist. After a moment he climbs up into the sling.
Testing. He shouts back to Bobby.
PINKLE (CONT'D)
Probably a short in the switch.
Pinkle reaches down and hits the switch a couple of time; finally, the bar lifts, the chains
tighten and the salesman rises.

There we go ...

9.  ROADHOUSE - DAY
The entry doors have been closed, the tables pushed against the front wall. Two rows of
chairs face a long, solid judge's table at the back of the room. Andy escorts Leland past
Cooper and Truman, standing near the door, to a defendant's table in the front row. The
prosecutor's table sits alongside, SARAH PALMER and MADDY FERGUSON sit behind
Leland in the second row, along with a few habitual COURT WITNESSES. Leland takes
Sarah's hand for a moment.
The small group stands as JUDGE CLINTON STERNWOOD, all in shining black robes,
strides expansively into the room; a rich, magisterial presence and powerful, uncluttered
eyes. His trailed by SID, his bailiff. Appraising the prosecutorless situation, Sternwood stops
beside Cooper and Truman.
STERNWOOD
Morning. Where's Lodwick the prosecutor?
TRUMAN
Hasn't shown.
STERNWOOD
(nods; there'll be a delay)
Took a long constitutional this morning. The path
leading down to the waterfall. A fine, invigorating
mist in the air. There was a twelve-point buck
drinking from the pool; he saw me but didn't bolt.
Time stood still. I In the presence of the eternal, I

HORNE
Your Honor, a pleasure, sorry I missed you last night.
STERNWOOD
Your dining room served a wild boar with a cherry
sauce that I haven't yet found the words to describe.
(to Cooper)
I've been around the Great Northern since the dawn
of man. Hammered my way through law school
there.
HORNE
Clinton worked construction for my father. In my
boyhood memory he built half the hotel singlehandedly.
COOPER
There's a door near my room, opening out to the
back, that's like nothing I've ever seen. Two panel
oak, all joined with tongues, tenons, and dowels.
Not a nail or a screw in it.
STERNWOOD
Thank you. I remember that door. Dryclamped and
lying in the sun. Beautiful piece of work -
DARRYL LODWICK, the state prosecutor, arrives, apologetically approaching Sternwood.
LODWICK
Sorry, I had a bit of trouble. Lost my wallet.
STERNWOOD

Enter the State.

#2.005
10.  ROADHOUSE - DAY
Sitting alone and imposing at his long table, Sternwood GAVELS and commences.
STERNWOOD
Mr. Palmer has pleaded not guilty to the charge of
murder in the first degree. Defense has requested
bail. This is a pretrial hearing to determine if that
bail will be granted. Mr. Prosecutor ...
LODWICK
We, the people of the state of Washington, move that
the defendant be denied bail on the basis of: 1)the
great seriousness of the crime for which he's been
accused; 2) the apparently premeditated nature of
this act; and 3) the oft-witnessed instability of Mr.
Palmer during the period following the death of his
daughter.
All eyes are on Leland as Lodwick sits.
STERNWOOD
Sheriff Truman will speak for the defense.
TRUMAN
Mr. Palmer is a well-known, respected member of
this community, with a good professional reputation
and established roots. And beyond that ... I'd like
to say that none of us can really know what it's like to
lose a seventeen year-old daughter the way he did.
What that might do to any one of us ...
(suddenly self-conscious)
That's all.
Sternwood deliberates. Truman takes his seat beside Andy, who is glancing up and over a
row up at Leland's partial profile. Truman glances down at the sketchpad in Andy's lap and
sees ...
Andy's sketch of Leland, from the same angle as just seen by Truman: a profile favoring the
back left side of the head.
Andy notices Truman's attention.
ANDY
I thought I might sell this to the Gazette. They
seem to like courtroom sketches.
TRUMAN
You might try for a little more of his face. Just a
suggestion.

ANDY
Good. Thanks, Sheriff.
Sternwood gavels.
STERNWOOD
On the basis of his high standing in the community,
the pristine nature of his public and private
reputation and his evident respect for the letter of the
law, which is well known to me ... defendant is
released on his own recognizance. Leland, as you
know, I'll require you to remain in town, making
your whereabouts known to the Sheriff on a regular
basis. Sid, check the calendar. We'll set the date for
Mr. Palmer's trial.
Reactions all round: for Leland, a shred of dignity retained.

Alright. I'm from Twin Peaks. That is I was born
here. My father delivered me. He's a doctor.
Where are you from?
HAROLD
I grew up in Boston. Actually, I grew up in books.
DONNA
There are things you can't get from books.
HAROLD
There are things you can't get anywhere. But we
dream they can be found in other people. Continue.
Donna stands, comes over to the desk coquettishly along its edge.
DONNA
Maybe our dreams are real.
Harold nervously pull back. Donna quickly grabs Laura's diary and playfully steps away.

DONNA
Maybe I'll read it out here on the lawn.
HAROLD
Give that back to me, please.
DONNA
Why don't you come out with me? Come on.
What's there to be afraid of?
She backs through the open doorway. He bolts forward; but suddenly it's as if she's backed
over a cliff. His face flushes at the flood of daylight. A trembling ignites in his fingers.
HAROLD
Oh God ... oh God ...
DONNA
Harold?
He gets down on the ground, hyperventilating, looking almost paralyzed.
DONNA (CONTINUED).
Harold?
His breathing locks. She hurries to him, kneels down, half-props him against her chest, he
grasps at her, trying to breathe again.
DONNA
It's all right. It's all right. I'm so sorry.
HAROLD
I just ... I just got too close.
DONNA
To what?
As his panic fades, seeking and finding permission in her eyes, he kisses her tenderly. They
look at each other.

13.  ROADHOUSE - DAY
Leo Johnson competency hearing. Judge Sternwood is holding court, facing Prosecutor
Lodwick and JACK RACINE, a sardonic defense attorney representing Leo Johnson.
We begin CLOSE ON a blown-up photograph of Leo Johnson, before and after injury and a
diagram on an easel Racine is showing to the judge and closeby gallery area, occupied by
Cooper, Truman, and Shelly Johnson. The diagram is of two EEG waves, one large and
varied, the other flat and undisclosing.
RACINE
You can see by these EEG's, the one above, which is
actually of my own head and intended to show
normal brain activity . The line below is of Mr.
Johnson and shows minimal activity. The previously
submitted medical report states that Mr. Johnson has
suffered diffuse brain damage. He isn't currently
even capable of taking the standard CST
competency tests. We therefore submit that trying
this individual would constitute a mockery of the
justice system, a proceeding the unfortunate young
man wold not even faintly comprehend.
Racine withdraws.
STERNWOOD
Mr. Prosecutor.
Lodwick stands, takes a posturing step toward an almost empty gallery, and accidentally
makes eye contact with Shelly Johnson before folding back toward the judge.
LODWICK
I know that Leo Johnson isn't in very good shape. On
the surface, it might seem ridiculous to make him
stand trial. But a trial doesn't just punish a
wrongdoer; it also brings a feeling of justice and
retribution to a community. Among the various
crimes he's suspected of, the murder of Laura Palmer
is the sort that can wound an entire town.

LODWICK (continued)
For there to be even a shred of feeling that the
perpetrator of this terrible crime got away with it -
(Sternwood starts to wave him off)
- this simply cannot be. As long as Leo Johnson
carries a breath, he is as eminently deserving of a
trial as this community is of a resolution -
STERNWOOD
All right, have a seat, Mr. Lodwick. You fellas catch
your breath, I'm going to need to deliberate.
(rises)
Mr. Cooper, Sheriff Truman if I could have the
pleasure of your company ...
Sternwood waves them over to join him at the bar.
STERNWOOD (CONT'D)
Sid, how about fixing me up a Black Yukon on Sucker
Punch?
Sid contentedly goes to work behind the bar, concocting an elaborate drink. Cooper and
Truman flank Sternwood at the bar.
STERNWOOD (CONT'D)
Lodwick really planted his feet and looked it in the
eye. I didn't think he'd press on the murder charge.
Is Leo Johnson your man?
COOPER
No, sir, I don't believe he is.
STERNWOOD
Harry, what's the town's temperature? Do they want
a trial or a lynching?
TRUMAN
They want the right man brought to justice.
STERNWOOD
Then they don't a need a circus. This poor bastard
seems to be a head of cabbage. Thoughts, Cooper?
COOPER
I feel the right man will eventually be apprehended.
Sid brings Sternwood his drink. With full ritualistic relish, Sternwood lights a cigar. Looks

When medically possible, he may be sent home.
Harry, maybe you'd like to tell the little lady
yourself.
Truman nods gratefully, moves to Shelly.
STERNWOOD (CONT'D)
How long you been here, Cooper?
COOPER
Close to two weeks, sir.
STERNWOOD
I'll advise you to keep your eye on the woods. The
woods are wondrous here. But strange.
Sternwood drinks his drink, his eye on some distant, sinister horizon. Truman kneels down
beside Shelly, who, distracted, doesn't notice him at first.
TRUMAN
Shelly? They're not going to try him.
Her silent, complex response.
TRUMAN (CONT'D)
Leo's coming home.

Second session.
Harold looks up at Donna, waits for her to begin. Donna pauses, tongue-tied, a little

This is from a long time ago. Is that okay?

All right. Uhm ... I'm thirteen years old. Fourteen
maybe. Me and Laura put on our tightest shortest
skirts. Too tight, but Laura talks me into it. And we
go to the roadhouse to meet boys.
Donna pauses. Harold watches her intently, writes as he listens. The room is suddenly very
quiet and still. Almost eerie. As Donna gains the confidence to remember:
DONNA
Their names are Josh, Rick, and Tim. About twenty
years old . A nd they're nice to us, they treat us like
we're older. Rick asks if we want to parry and Laura
says yes.

There's a stream in the woods. It seems pale and
light out. The boys build a fire. I like Tim the
best. He isn't so full of loud jokes like the others.

Rick gets out a bottle of vodka and Laura starts
drinking. I can't believe how much she drinks. She
hands it to me. I take a sip. It feels good.

Laura starts to dance around the boys. Moving her
 hips back and forth. Rick starts to clap. But Tim

When Laura starts to kiss Josh and Rick, I don't know
what to do. So I swim away. I think maybe I want
to run but I don't. Tim swims over to me. I let him
kiss me. And I let him touch me. Once.

When we leave, and this is what I remember best, the
boys are really nice. They don't make fun or talk
down to us. And Tim ... Tim kisses my hand when
we say goodbye. Then he kisses me.

I can still feel that kiss. His lips are warm and
sweet. My heart sort of jumps. He's talking to me
but I don't really hear him. Just the kiss.

I never saw him again. It was the first time I ever
fell in love. But Laura ...
Donna exhales, a little overwhelmed. Tears shine in her dark eyes.

Humidity is paramount. The control of it, I mean.
Too much moisture is an invitation to disease.

Jack's. And he's not alone.

35.  AROUND BACK - NIGHT
Up over a hillside ridge, a walkway runs just the back French doors. ANGLE ON a GUARD
on patrol. He hears a NOISE behind him and starts to reach for his gun, but there's suddenly
a strong yank on his arm. Truman stuffs a rubber ball into his mouth and almost
simultaneously slaps into handcuffs behind his back. Then from another pocket in his jacket,
he seals the ball in place with tape. Cooper inspects Truman's JACKET. A modified fishing
vest loaded with burglary tools. Cooper nods appreciatively. Gestures forward.
They approach the back door. Locked. Truman plants in odd piece of iron between the
French doors. Props it between the French doors, pushes the doors in and as they bounce
back out and OPEN.

36.  ONE-EYED JACK'S - NIGHT
Cooper and Truman enter atop a long, ill-lit stairway. They look about, alert, ready for
anything, then start down the stairs. Party sounds abound from the adjoining main rooms.

They, freeze against the wall: She looks up the stairs and happily prances right past them, a
little drunk, not seeing. Cooper and Truman exhale. They descend past this level toward the
darkness of the bottom floor.

37.  ONE-EYED JACK'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
Cooper and Truman move stealthily down the hallway. They near Blackie's office, a window,
their view limited by drooping red curtains. Truman peers inside. Signals "two" occupants to
Cooper. Cooper gestures a reply. Stay put. I'll circle in the other direction. HOLD ON
Truman for a beat, as he scoots closer, tries to get a better look inside.

38.  ONE-EYED JACK'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
Cooper moves quietly down the hall, looking left and right. Suddenly a woman appears. It's
Nancy, Blackie's sister. Cooper doesn't hesitate.
COOPER
(coldly determined)
Please take me to Audrey Horne. Now.
NANCY
(figuring her options)
I don't think she's available.
Cooper takes out his pistol.
COOPER
Let's double check.
Cooper takes Nancy by the arm. Allows her to lead him forward.

39.  BLACKIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
START CLOSE on a video monitor showing Cooper playing blackjack. ANOTHER ANGLE
reveals Jean Renault, glancing at the screen from time to time. He holds a small spoon in one
hand, a lighter in the other. He fixing a hot shot for Audrey. Blackie watches, waits.
BLACKIE

Not such a bad way to go. All things considered.

BLACKIE
Nancy's with her.

What does she do for you that I can't?
RENAULT

You do all right.
Renault loads the syringe with a practiced hand. Everything proceeds in business-like fashion.
Blackie steps a little closer, eyes on the drugs that remain.

40.  ONE-EYED JACK'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
Truman leans against the wall, having witnessed much of the latter. He looks down the
hallway for Cooper, some sign. But sees and hear nothing. Truman scoots a little closer to the
office door. Considers his next move.

41.  ONE-EYED JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Cooper and Nancy enter the bedroom. Cooper sees Audrey, dazed, bound up on the bed.
He gives Nancy a quick stare: of controlled rage. She equivocates:
NANCY
It's not my idea, okay? We're nothin' but meat on a
hook to these people.
(imploring)
I'll do whatever I can to help. Serious.
Cooper's not listening. He kneels at Audrey's side.
COOPER
Audrey. Can you hear me?
AUDREY

Mmmmm ... Who ... ? ... My ... my prayers ...

COOPER
(quiet, intense)
Audrey, I'm going to take you out of here now.
Cooper hears the sound of brushing silk. He reacts, turns in time to SEE Nancy take a stiletto
out of her boot. Her hand sweeps forward, blade flashing. Cooper shifts to avoid. But the
steel catches his arm, rips and tears. Cooper grabs Nancy's wrist with his free hand, wrenches
the knife from her grasp, sends her sprawling with a punch to the jaw. She's out cold.
Cooper retrieves the knife, cuts Audrey's ropes. He bundles her in the top blanket, takes
Audrey into his arms. Cooper moves as quickly as is possible. He knows he is running out of
time.

42. / BLACKIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Truman watches as Renault places the loaded syringe in his pocket Steps toward the door.
Blackie follows, now steps in his path. She smirks, sidles into Renault's arms. A deep kiss.
Truman crouches by the doorway, reaches for his pistol. Ready for action. Just then: the
unmistakable WHISTLE of Renault's spring-loaded KNIFE.
Blackie gasps, sags. Feels the blade enter her torso. Renault removes the knife, releases her.
Blackie falls dead from his embrace to the floor.
Truman reacts with shock. pistol in hand, he stands, turns toward the office.
Inside the office, Renault spots Truman. He reaches for a pistol, FIRES. Truman ducks for
cover. Renault's bullet strikes a window, glass shatters, flies. Truman marine crawls to a
better vantage po He rolls, pistol aimed, ready to fire, but Renault is GONE.

43.  ONE-EYED JACK'S -CORRIDOR
Cooper hurries down the corridor, Audrey in his arms. Truman meets him from the opposite
direction. Neither has time for conversation. They turn toward the nearest exit. Truman leads
the way. Suddenly: another BODYGUARD appears between them and the exit. He holds a
gun in his hands. Means to use it.
BODYGUARD
Drop the gun.
Truman deliberately places his gun on the floor. Cooper holds Audrey tightly in his arms,
says nothing. The bodyguard's gun cocks. Then a hollow drum-like SOUND. Truman turns
to see the guard fall forward, a bowie knife lodged deep between his scapulas. Halfway up
the stairs is Hawk.
HAWK
Good thing you guys can't keep a secret.
Cooper, Truman, and Hawk dart up the stairs.

44.  THE HIGH RIDGE - NIGHT
Cooper, Truman, and Hawk are VIEWED from a HIGH ANGLE. Racing with Audrey into
the shadows.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals this to be Hank's POV. He speaks into the cellular phone:
HANK
(into phone)
There's been gun fire. Cooper and Truman are
leaving with your daughter .....
A GUN moves into FRAME, pointed at Hank's head. Hank hangs up without another word.
SHOT EXPANDS to show Jean Renault holding the pistol.
Hank's hands slowly go up. Renault reaches over into Hank's coat pocket and pulls out a
wallet. Opens it. He reacts with surprise.

Donna peers out the greenhouse window into the living room. Follows Maddy's progress.
Suddenly: Harold Smith returns, takes her by surprise. Donna reacts with a start.
DONNA
Hi.
HAROLD
(suspicious; eye on window)
Is something wrong?
Harold turns toward the window. Donna moves to intercept.
DONNA
No. You scared me a little that's all. I ...
Harold pulls free from her grasp, steps to the window. Donna nearly pleads.
DONNA
Tell me about the orchids. This one ...
Too late. Harold stalks forward.

Maddy excitedly reaches for the diary with Laura's name embossed upon it. She pulls it out

Harold Smith stands on the other side of the glass, face distorted, now staring at her with
anger.

himself between her and the door, armed with the metal tool. Donna reaches for his arm, he
rips free from her grasp, shoves her toward Maddy and the hidden books.
Maddy and Donna stand together, breathless, afraid. Harold Smith pauses, just stares at them
for a beat Feels the black weight of their betrayal. Then, quietly, almost a whisper, he speaks:
HAROLD
Are you looking for secrets? Is that it? Maybe I can
give you one. Do you want to know what the
ultimate secret is? Laura did.
(eyes flaring)
The secret of knowing who killed you.
Maddy screams.

COOPER sits on the edge of the bed in his boxer shorts. Flips on his tape recorder.
COOPER
Diane, it's 6:42 a.m., a bit of a late start, due to a
persisting soreness in the rib area ...
(rises tentatively)
An ache that feels as if a wing were cut away in my
sleep.
(approaching)
Diane, a strange dream to report: I dreamt I was
eating a large, tasteless gumdrop. I soon awoke to
realize I was aggressively munching on one of my
Air-Pillow Silicon Ear Plugs. Hence the
tastelessness. I suspect some unexpressed feeling of
aggression is responsible.
(drops to crouch)
Diane, rather than equilibrate through the use of my
gravity boots, which could induce further rib
separation, this morning I'm going to attempt a
headstand.
(rolls up onto the wall)
I'm now upside down, my mind becoming porous,
the day tasks coming into focus, objects growing
clearer ...
Looking out in the darkness of the stained wood floor, which now looks to us like the ceiling.
Cooper sees a white envelope under, or rather over, the bed. Cooper unfurls and reaches for
it.
COOPER

"My special agent ..."

HAWK
A pair of retired female schoolteachers lived in that

LUCY MORAN walks up carrying a day bag and looking a little teary-eyed.
LUCY
Excuse me, Sheriff, I'm sorry to interrupt, but
Sheriff, I just wanted to say goodbye because as you
know, I'm going down to Tacoma for two days to
visit my sister, Gwen and her husband, Larry, who
had a baby last week, you remember, it was a boy
and as soon as the Can Do temp girl gets here I'll
explain the phones and the coffee and the intercom
and the Wagon Wheel Do-Nut run and ... and ...
TRUMAN
Lucy. It's okay.
LUCY
No, she should have been here by now, I can wait and
at least show her ... show her ...
TRUMAN
Lucy. Go.
With silent gratitude, she picks up her bag and exits ahead of Hawk. Cooper then enters,
eyes cool, intently ablaze. Both he and Truman instinctively step toward an empty corridor.
COOPER

7.  LEO JOHNSON'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
A hospital bed has replaced the living room sofa. In a wheelchair beside the bed sits BOBBY
BRIGGS, allowing the medical supplies salesman, TIM PINKLE, to demonstrate a lifting
apparatus. Pinkle is a pasty, perspiration-prone man with an affectation of high duty.
SHELLY JOHNSON stands a step removed, looking on.
PINKLE
The Port-O-Patient will allow you to fluently
transport the unfortunate Mr. Johnson, allowing him
even to sit outside and experience what he can of
nature.
BOBBY
(resolutely)
Mr. Pinkle, I want my cousin Leo to have the fullest
possible experience of life.
PINKLE
That's what we're here for. Let's take
Pinkle inspects the electrical engine that, along with the rest of the host, looks to be quite
antiquated. Bobby sits in the loose body sling connected to an overhead bar by two sagging
crossing chains, giving this crane-like device the look of a silvery praying mantis.
SHELLY
Mr. Pinkle are you going to put in a ramp.
PINKLE
Ah... sure. I've got some plywood, uh, pinewood
ramp boards I'll install outside. Absolutely.
Pinkle finds the switch to start the engine.
PINKLE (CONT'D)
Okay, here we go.
He flips the switch. Nothing happens.
PINKLE (CONT'D)
That's a new wrinkle. It was working the other day.
Pinkle fiddles with the cord to the socket. Nothing. Suddenly the engine starts. The bar jerks
up and the chains snap tight across a frightened Bobby, who's yanked up from his seat and
tossed back down. Then the machine stops. Flashing Pinkle a homicidal look, Bobby fights his
way out of the chains, sling, and chair.
SHELLY
Bobby, 'you alright?

7. CONTINUED:
BOBBY
How about getting Mr. Pinkle a cold drink?
As Shelly leaves, Bobby pulls Pinkle aside by the back of his neck.
BOBBY
That thing's a death trap, Pinkle. I told you we have
to keep him alive.
PINKLE
Insurance companies don't exactly pay off like the
slots. After both our cuts, it was either this or a firstrate wheelbarrow.
Shelly returns. Pinkle takes the soda and dives into tinkering with the machine.
SHELLY
(needs a private word)
Bobby?
(beat)
I've got to meet Leo's lawyer.
BOBBY
(taking her into the kitchen)
The hearing's today, right?
PINKLE (O.S.)
Be just another second, folks.
SHELLY
Bobby, are we okay?
His response is a passionate stare. She smolders back. With Pinkle about, they can do no
more than look and want. But outside ... Bobby takes her hand.
BOBBY
Come on, he can let himself out.
They exit. Pinkle, studies the non-working hoist. After a moment he climbs up into the sling.
Testing. He shouts back to Bobby.
PINKLE (CONT'D)
Probably a short in the switch.
Pinkle reaches down and hits the switch a couple of time; finally, the bar lifts, the chains
tighten and the salesman rises.
PINKLE (CONT'D)
There we go ...

But the machine doesn't stop, lifting Pinkle up to a precarious height and pulling him back,
his arms pinned by the crossing chains.

Bobby? ... Bobby?

Establish.

9.  ROADHOUSE - DAY
The entry doors have been closed, the tables pushed against the front wall. Two rows of
chairs face a long, solid judge's table at the back of the room. Andy escorts Leland past
Cooper and Truman, standing near the door, to a defendant's table in the front row. The
prosecutor's table sits alongside, SARAH PALMER and MADDY FERGUSON sit behind
Leland in the second row, along with a few habitual COURT WITNESSES. Leland takes
Sarah's hand for a moment.
The small group stands as JUDGE CLINTON STERNWOOD, all in shining black robes,
strides expansively into the room; a rich, magisterial presence and powerful, uncluttered
eyes. His trailed by SID, his bailiff. Appraising the prosecutorless situation, Sternwood stops
beside Cooper and Truman.
STERNWOOD
Morning. Where's Lodwick the prosecutor?
TRUMAN
Hasn't shown.
STERNWOOD
(nods; there'll be a delay)
Took a long constitutional this morning. The path
leading down to the waterfall. A fine, invigorating
mist in the air. There was a twelve-point buck
drinking from the pool; he saw me but didn't bolt.
Time stood still. I In the presence of the eternal, I
suppose that's as it should be.

BEN HORNE has entered, late, immediately makes his way to the power in the room.
STERNWOOD
Benjamin.
HORNE
Your Honor, a pleasure, sorry I missed you last night.
STERNWOOD
Your dining room served a wild boar with a cherry
sauce that I haven't yet found the words to describe.
(to Cooper)
I've been around the Great Northern since the dawn
of man. Hammered my way through law school
there.
HORNE
Clinton worked construction for my father. In my
boyhood memory he built half the hotel singlehandedly.
COOPER
There's a door near my room, opening out to the
back, that's like nothing I've ever seen. Two panel
oak, all joined with tongues, tenons, and dowels.
Not a nail or a screw in it.
STERNWOOD
Thank you. I remember that door. Dryclamped and
lying in the sun. Beautiful piece of work -
DARRYL LODWICK, the state prosecutor, arrives, apologetically approaching Sternwood.
LODWICK
Sorry, I had a bit of trouble. Lost my wallet.
STERNWOOD
(dryly)
Enter the State.

#2.005
10.  ROADHOUSE - DAY
Sitting alone and imposing at his long table, Sternwood GAVELS and commences.
STERNWOOD
Mr. Palmer has pleaded not guilty to the charge of
murder in the first degree. Defense has requested
bail. This is a pretrial hearing to determine if that
bail will be granted. Mr. Prosecutor ...
LODWICK
We, the people of the state of Washington, move that
the defendant be denied bail on the basis of: 1)the
great seriousness of the crime for which he's been
accused; 2) the apparently premeditated nature of
this act; and 3) the oft-witnessed instability of Mr.
Palmer during the period following the death of his
daughter.
All eyes are on Leland as Lodwick sits.
STERNWOOD
Sheriff Truman will speak for the defense.
TRUMAN
Mr. Palmer is a well-known, respected member of
this community, with a good professional reputation
and established roots. And beyond that ... I'd like
to say that none of us can really know what it's like to
lose a seventeen year-old daughter the way he did.
What that might do to any one of us ...
(suddenly self-conscious)
That's all.
Sternwood deliberates. Truman takes his seat beside Andy, who is glancing up and over a
row up at Leland's partial profile. Truman glances down at the sketchpad in Andy's lap and
sees ...
Andy's sketch of Leland, from the same angle as just seen by Truman: a profile favoring the
back left side of the head.
Andy notices Truman's attention.
ANDY
I thought I might sell this to the Gazette. They
seem to like courtroom sketches.
TRUMAN
You might try for a little more of his face. Just a
suggestion.
(CONTINUED)

#2.005
10. CONTINUED:
ANDY
Good. Thanks, Sheriff.
Sternwood gavels.
STERNWOOD
On the basis of his high standing in the community,
the pristine nature of his public and private
reputation and his evident respect for the letter of the
law, which is well known to me ... defendant is
released on his own recognizance. Leland, as you
know, I'll require you to remain in town, making
your whereabouts known to the Sheriff on a regular
basis. Sid, check the calendar. We'll set the date for
Mr. Palmer's trial.
Reactions all round: for Leland, a shred of dignity retained.

So, what behind those deep blue eyes today?
DONNA
I've got a proposition for you.
HAROLD

Now you've got my attention.
DONNA
I'll share my fife with you. I'll tell it to you. Be a

Harold undoes the secret bookshelf. Donna tries not to make an obvious point of observing.
He tries to casually conceal the fact he's concealing how the locking mechanism works. He
takes out a fresh ledger, lays Laura's diary on the desk beside him, makes a show of taking
out an expensive fountain pen and cracks open the new book.
HAROLD
(writing in the frontispiece)
Donna ... Hayward.
(smiles, simply)
Begin ...
DONNA
Alright. I'm from Twin Peaks. That is I was born
here. My father delivered me. He's a doctor.
Where are you from?
HAROLD
I grew up in Boston. Actually, I grew up in books.
DONNA
There are things you can't get from books.
HAROLD
There are things you can't get anywhere. But we
dream they can be found in other people. Continue.
Donna stands, comes over to the desk coquettishly along its edge.

Maybe I'll read it out here on the lawn.
HAROLD
Give that back to me, please.
DONNA
Why don't you come out with me? Come on.
What's there to be afraid of?
She backs through the open doorway. He bolts forward; but suddenly it's as if she's backed
over a cliff. His face flushes at the flood of daylight. A trembling ignites in his fingers.
HAROLD
Oh God ... oh God ...
DONNA
Harold?
He gets down on the ground, hyperventilating, looking almost paralyzed.
DONNA (CONTINUED).
Harold?
His breathing locks. She hurries to him, kneels down, half-props him against her chest, he
grasps at her, trying to breathe again.
DONNA
It's all right. It's all right. I'm so sorry.
HAROLD
I just ... I just got too close.
DONNA
To what?
As his panic fades, seeking and finding permission in her eyes, he kisses her tenderly. They

13.  ROADHOUSE - DAY
Leo Johnson competency hearing. Judge Sternwood is holding court, facing Prosecutor
Lodwick and JACK RACINE, a sardonic defense attorney representing Leo Johnson.
We begin CLOSE ON a blown-up photograph of Leo Johnson, before and after injury and a
diagram on an easel Racine is showing to the judge and closeby gallery area, occupied by
Cooper, Truman, and Shelly Johnson. The diagram is of two EEG waves, one large and
varied, the other flat and undisclosing.
RACINE
You can see by these EEG's, the one above, which is
actually of my own head and intended to show
normal brain activity . The line below is of Mr.
Johnson and shows minimal activity. The previously
submitted medical report states that Mr. Johnson has
suffered diffuse brain damage. He isn't currently
even capable of taking the standard CST
competency tests. We therefore submit that trying
this individual would constitute a mockery of the
justice system, a proceeding the unfortunate young
man wold not even faintly comprehend.
Racine withdraws.
STERNWOOD
Mr. Prosecutor.
Lodwick stands, takes a posturing step toward an almost empty gallery, and accidentally
makes eye contact with Shelly Johnson before folding back toward the judge.
LODWICK
I know that Leo Johnson isn't in very good shape. On
the surface, it might seem ridiculous to make him
stand trial. But a trial doesn't just punish a
wrongdoer; it also brings a feeling of justice and
retribution to a community. Among the various
crimes he's suspected of, the murder of Laura Palmer
is the sort that can wound an entire town.

LODWICK (continued)
For there to be even a shred of feeling that the
perpetrator of this terrible crime got away with it -
(Sternwood starts to wave him off)
- this simply cannot be. As long as Leo Johnson
carries a breath, he is as eminently deserving of a
trial as this community is of a resolution -
STERNWOOD
All right, have a seat, Mr. Lodwick. You fellas catch
your breath, I'm going to need to deliberate.
(rises)
Mr. Cooper, Sheriff Truman if I could have the
pleasure of your company ...
Sternwood waves them over to join him at the bar.
STERNWOOD (CONT'D)
Sid, how about fixing me up a Black Yukon on Sucker
Punch?
Sid contentedly goes to work behind the bar, concocting an elaborate drink. Cooper and
Truman flank Sternwood at the bar.
STERNWOOD (CONT'D)
Lodwick really planted his feet and looked it in the
eye. I didn't think he'd press on the murder charge.
Is Leo Johnson your man?
COOPER
No, sir, I don't believe he is.
STERNWOOD
Harry, what's the town's temperature? Do they want
a trial or a lynching?
TRUMAN
They want the right man brought to justice.
STERNWOOD
Then they don't a need a circus. This poor bastard
seems to be a head of cabbage. Thoughts, Cooper?

When medically possible, he may be sent home.
Harry, maybe you'd like to tell the little lady
yourself.
Truman nods gratefully, moves to Shelly.
STERNWOOD (CONT'D)
How long you been here, Cooper?
COOPER
Close to two weeks, sir.
STERNWOOD
I'll advise you to keep your eye on the woods. The
woods are wondrous here. But strange.
Sternwood drinks his drink, his eye on some distant, sinister horizon. Truman kneels down
beside Shelly, who, distracted, doesn't notice him at first.

the elbow. BLACKIE watches.
RENAULT
Cooper hands me the briefcase. I take it.
Renault thrusts out his forearm as if to take a briefcase. With a distinct sound, the knife
whistles down the chute and bolts to a stop well past the hand area, a show of gleaming,
finest-cut steel blade.
BLACKIE
What about Ben Horne?
RENAULT
He relinquishes control of Jack's. It's all yours.
BLACKIE
With his daughter dead?
RENAULT
You love a good steak, but you don't want to know
how it got on your plate.

With Battis gone and Home out of the way, you're
going to have to get serious about your business,

The front door opens. TOJAMURA enters. Norma freezes. Tojamura nods.
NORMA

Tojamura, nods again. Norma shows him to a booth facing the front window and hands him
a newly calligraphic menu. Maddy hurries into the diner. Stops short when she sees James.
Tries to look past him looking for a waitress
JAMES
Hi.

Maddy leaves. James probingly watches. Waits. Then gets up and follows her out. Norma
and Hank exit from the kitchen, Norm carrying a plate of food. She points out Tojamura to
Hank.
NORMA
Louise said he checked into the Great Northern under
the name of Tojamura. This must be the food critic.
HANK
Does he have ponytail?
(Norma nods "yes")
I think he's been here already.
NORMA
What? When?
HANK
Let me handle this.
Hank takes the plate from Norma, moves towards Tojamura carrying the sliced turkey and
mashed potatoes smothered with gravy. Norma looks on anxiously from the back of the
room. Hank glides up and slides the plate through the air, holding it for an instant under
Tojamura's.
HANK
Our specialty.
He then shoves the back of the Asian's head forward, ramming his face into the gravy
mountain of mashed potatoes. Hank drops the plate on the table, slaps his palms clean in selfsatisfaction, and looks back at a stunned Norma.
HANK (CONTINUED)
This guy's no critic, he's a ...
Tojamura's mud-and-cloud face rises. Hank glances down. Realizes. Wrong Asian. He looks

manning the switchboard. His chest and surrounding area are covered with yellow post-it
notes.
ANDY
(into phone)
No, sir, I'm sure not the regular girl. She's gone to
Tacoma to visit her sister. There's supposed to be a
number for her written down here somewhere.
Andy begins to look for it, but that's not what the caller is concerned about. Andy listens to
him for a moment.
ANDY (CONTINUED)
Well, I'm certainly not a lawyer, sir, but my
interpretation of the law would be that if your
neighbor's cow has each of his four hoofs completely
on his property, but his head is stretched over into
your property and he's chewing up your ...
(listens)
Well, I'm certainly no veterinarian, but I think that
would kill the cow. Right. Okay. Bye.
Andy disconnects. A pause in the action brings him to his moment of truth. He takes out a
scribbled piece of paper. Exhales. Dials.
ANDY (CONTINUED)

Yeah, I'm calling for some test results. Doc
Hayward said I could just call you an ... what's it

Get-acquainted Room.
HAWK enters. Cooper adroitly sweeps the map to the side, a move the deputy notices.
HAWK
The one-armed man's been staying at a motel on
Highway 9. No one's seen him for the last day, dayand-a-half. His room looks lived in. I found this.
Hawk empties a paper bag of SYRINGES and several VIALS OF LIQUID.
HAWK (CONTINUED)
Same drug, as before.
(taking a whiff of it)
Weird, deep smell.
COOPER
We're still waiting for Albert's analysis. Good
work, Hawk.
Hawk grabs a look at the plans. Truman dismisses Hawk's concern.

Maddy sits behind the front bushes, coffee cup in hand, eyes fixed on Harold Smith's
bedroom window.

31.  HAROLD SMITH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Donna and Harold sit together as before, she on the chair, he behind the desk. Harold opens
the diary with quiet ceremony. Quietly, with muted intensity, he begins:
HAROLD
(as he writes)
Donna Hayward. Tuesday. March the seventh.
Second session.
Harold looks up at Donna, waits for her to begin. Donna pauses, tongue-tied, a little
embarrassed. She sips from her glass of wine, as if to seek inspiration. Harold offers a
comforting smile. And some unexpected humor:
HAROLD
(gentle prompting)
"Dear Diary ...
Donna smiles, shrugs.
HAROLD
Tell me a story.
DONNA
What kind?
HAROLD
Anything you like. It's a diary. Filled with loves
and hates.
(CONTINUED)
30.
#2.005
31. CONTINUED:
DONNA
(as it to decide upon the theme)
Loves.
HAROLD
Good.
A beat. Harold waits for her to begin. Takes a sip from his own glass of wine. Finally:
DONNA
Uhm ... "Dear Diary ..."
(to Harold)
This is from a long time ago. Is that okay?
(he nods assent)
All right. Uhm ... I'm thirteen years old. Fourteen
maybe. Me and Laura put on our tightest shortest
skirts. Too tight, but Laura talks me into it. And we
go to the roadhouse to meet boys.
Donna pauses. Harold watches her intently, writes as he listens. The room is suddenly very
quiet and still. Almost eerie. As Donna gains the confidence to remember:
DONNA
Their names are Josh, Rick, and Tim. About twenty
years old . A nd they're nice to us, they treat us like
we're older. Rick asks if we want to parry and Laura
says yes.
(beat)
There's a stream in the woods. It seems pale and
light out. The boys build a fire. I like Tim the
best. He isn't so full of loud jokes like the others.
(beat)
Rick gets out a bottle of vodka and Laura starts
drinking. I can't believe how much she drinks. She
hands it to me. I take a sip. It feels good.
(beat)
Laura starts to dance around the boys. Moving her
 hips back and forth. Rick starts to clap. But Tim
doesn't do anything. He just watches. Somehow that
makes me mad. So I say, "Let's go skinny-dipping."
(beat)

31. CONTINUED:(2)
DONNA (continued)
We take off our clothes. I know the boys are
watching us. The water feels really warm. The boy's
legs are white and I can see them under the water.
When Laura starts to kiss Josh and Rick, I don't know
what to do. So I swim away. I think maybe I want
to run but I don't. Tim swims over to me. I let him
kiss me. And I let him touch me. Once.
(beat)
When we leave, and this is what I remember best, the
boys are really nice. They don't make fun or talk
down to us. And Tim ... Tim kisses my hand when
we say goodbye. Then he kisses me.
(beat)
I can still feel that kiss. His lips are warm and
sweet. My heart sort of jumps. He's talking to me
but I don't really hear him. Just the kiss.
(beat)
I never saw him again. It was the first time I ever
fell in love. But Laura ...
Donna exhales, a little overwhelmed. Tears shine in her dark eyes.
DONNA
That's all.
(embarrassed; re tears)
Sorry.
HAROLD
That was beautiful, Donna.
Harold closes the diary.

32.  HAROLD SMITH'S GREENHOUSE - NIGHT
START CLOSE on a cymbidium orchid. Pale yellow and red. Quite beautiful. Harold
Smith's voice is HEARD.
HAROLD'S VOICE
Most people imagine orchids growing in exotic
steamy jungles. But you can grow them anywhere
with the right kind of care. I mean it's all basically
water and light, isn't it? Here. Look.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Harold and Donna in the greenhouse. Artificial light. Rows of
potted orchids. Harold delicately holds an orchid in his palm.
DONNA
It's beautiful.
HAROLD
(a quiet obsession)
Humidity is paramount. The control of it, I mean.
Too much moisture is an invitation to disease.
(pointing to appropriate parts)
Three sepals, three petals bottom petal shaped
like a lip is called the labellum.
DONNA
The colors ...
HAROLD
(re labellum)
It's a landing platform, really. For pollinating
insects.
Donna's fingers touch the petal. Then brush against Harold's hand.
DONNA
It's sort of romantic.
Harold now takes Donna's hand into his own. She turns toward him. And they kiss with
greater intensity than before. Something akin to passion. A beat. Harold steps back from her.
HAROLD
(with vague apprehension)
Will you excuse me for a minute?
(CONTINUED)

#2.005

DONNA
Sure.
Harold steps away into his bedroom. The SOUND of running water is HEARD. Donna
reaches into her purse, grabs the flashlight. And races toward the front window.

33.  HAROLD SMITH'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Maddy SEES the tiny window flashes. She rises up from behind the bushes and does an
eggshell walk toward the bungalow door.

34.  ONE-EYED JACK'S - NIGHT
Re-establish. Hank stands in the shadows, watches something in the near distance. He speaks
into a cellular telephone with quiet urgency.
HANK
(into phone)
Ben, we've got a problem. The drop at the merry-goround's not for two hours and Cooper's at One-Eyed
Jack's. And he's not alone.

35.  AROUND BACK - NIGHT
Up over a hillside ridge, a walkway runs just the back French doors. ANGLE ON a GUARD
on patrol. He hears a NOISE behind him and starts to reach for his gun, but there's suddenly
a strong yank on his arm. Truman stuffs a rubber ball into his mouth and almost
simultaneously slaps into handcuffs behind his back. Then from another pocket in his jacket,
he seals the ball in place with tape. Cooper inspects Truman's JACKET. A modified fishing
vest loaded with burglary tools. Cooper nods appreciatively. Gestures forward.
They approach the back door. Locked. Truman plants in odd piece of iron between the
French doors. Props it between the French doors, pushes the doors in and as they bounce
back out and OPEN.

36.  ONE-EYED JACK'S - NIGHT
Cooper and Truman enter atop a long, ill-lit stairway. They look about, alert, ready for
anything, then start down the stairs. Party sounds abound from the adjoining main rooms.
Cooper and Truman walk past the first hallway of noise, the casino, gliding by, trying to
make themselves invisible. As they approach the next level, a GIRL leads a CUSTOMER out
into the hall.

They, freeze against the wall: She looks up the stairs and happily prances right past them, a
little drunk, not seeing. Cooper and Truman exhale. They descend past this level toward the
darkness of the bottom floor.

37.  ONE-EYED JACK'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
Cooper and Truman move stealthily down the hallway. They near Blackie's office, a window,
their view limited by drooping red curtains. Truman peers inside. Signals "two" occupants to
Cooper. Cooper gestures a reply. Stay put. I'll circle in the other direction. HOLD ON
Truman for a beat, as he scoots closer, tries to get a better look inside.

38.  ONE-EYED JACK'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
Cooper moves quietly down the hall, looking left and right. Suddenly a woman appears. It's
Nancy, Blackie's sister. Cooper doesn't hesitate.
COOPER
(coldly determined)
Please take me to Audrey Horne. Now.
NANCY
(figuring her options)
I don't think she's available.
Cooper takes out his pistol.
COOPER
Let's double check.
Cooper takes Nancy by the arm. Allows her to lead him forward.

39.  BLACKIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
START CLOSE on a video monitor showing Cooper playing blackjack. ANOTHER ANGLE
reveals Jean Renault, glancing at the screen from time to time. He holds a small spoon in one
hand, a lighter in the other. He fixing a hot shot for Audrey. Blackie watches, waits.
BLACKIE

Not such a bad way to go. All things considered.

BLACKIE
Nancy's with her.

RENAULT

You do all right.
Renault loads the syringe with a practiced hand. Everything proceeds in business-like fashion.
Blackie steps a little closer, eyes on the drugs that remain.

40.  ONE-EYED JACK'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
Truman leans against the wall, having witnessed much of the latter. He looks down the
hallway for Cooper, some sign. But sees and hear nothing. Truman scoots a little closer to the
office door. Considers his next move.

41.  ONE-EYED JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Cooper and Nancy enter the bedroom. Cooper sees Audrey, dazed, bound up on the bed.
He gives Nancy a quick stare: of controlled rage. She equivocates:
NANCY
It's not my idea, okay? We're nothin' but meat on a
hook to these people.
(imploring)
I'll do whatever I can to help. Serious.
Cooper's not listening. He kneels at Audrey's side.
COOPER
Audrey. Can you hear me?
AUDREY

Mmmmm ... Who ... ? ... My ... my prayers ...

COOPER
(quiet, intense)
Audrey, I'm going to take you out of here now.
Cooper hears the sound of brushing silk. He reacts, turns in time to SEE Nancy take a stiletto
out of her boot. Her hand sweeps forward, blade flashing. Cooper shifts to avoid. But the
steel catches his arm, rips and tears. Cooper grabs Nancy's wrist with his free hand, wrenches
the knife from her grasp, sends her sprawling with a punch to the jaw. She's out cold.
Cooper retrieves the knife, cuts Audrey's ropes. He bundles her in the top blanket, takes
Audrey into his arms. Cooper moves as quickly as is possible. He knows he is running out of
time.

42. / BLACKIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Truman watches as Renault places the loaded syringe in his pocket Steps toward the door.
Blackie follows, now steps in his path. She smirks, sidles into Renault's arms. A deep kiss.
Truman crouches by the doorway, reaches for his pistol. Ready for action. Just then: the
unmistakable WHISTLE of Renault's spring-loaded KNIFE.
Blackie gasps, sags. Feels the blade enter her torso. Renault removes the knife, releases her.
Blackie falls dead from his embrace to the floor.
Truman reacts with shock. pistol in hand, he stands, turns toward the office.
Inside the office, Renault spots Truman. He reaches for a pistol, FIRES. Truman ducks for
cover. Renault's bullet strikes a window, glass shatters, flies. Truman marine crawls to a
better vantage po He rolls, pistol aimed, ready to fire, but Renault is GONE.

43.  ONE-EYED JACK'S -CORRIDOR
Cooper hurries down the corridor, Audrey in his arms. Truman meets him from the opposite
direction. Neither has time for conversation. They turn toward the nearest exit. Truman leads
the way. Suddenly: another BODYGUARD appears between them and the exit. He holds a
gun in his hands. Means to use it.
BODYGUARD
Drop the gun.
Truman deliberately places his gun on the floor. Cooper holds Audrey tightly in his arms,
says nothing. The bodyguard's gun cocks. Then a hollow drum-like SOUND. Truman turns
to see the guard fall forward, a bowie knife lodged deep between his scapulas. Halfway up
the stairs is Hawk.
HAWK
Good thing you guys can't keep a secret.
Cooper, Truman, and Hawk dart up the stairs.

44.  THE HIGH RIDGE - NIGHT
Cooper, Truman, and Hawk are VIEWED from a HIGH ANGLE. Racing with Audrey into
the shadows.
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals this to be Hank's POV. He speaks into the cellular phone:
HANK
(into phone)
There's been gun fire. Cooper and Truman are
leaving with your daughter .....
A GUN moves into FRAME, pointed at Hank's head. Hank hangs up without another word.
SHOT EXPANDS to show Jean Renault holding the pistol.
Hank's hands slowly go up. Renault reaches over into Hank's coat pocket and pulls out a
wallet. Opens it. He reacts with surprise.

Donna peers out the greenhouse window into the living room. Follows Maddy's progress.
Suddenly: Harold Smith returns, takes her by surprise. Donna reacts with a start.
DONNA
Hi.
HAROLD

Is something wrong?
Harold turns toward the window. Donna moves to intercept.
DONNA
No. You scared me a little that's all. I ...
Harold pulls free from her grasp, steps to the window. Donna nearly pleads.
DONNA
Tell me about the orchids. This one ...
Too late. Harold stalks forward.

47.  HAROLD SMITH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Maddy excitedly reaches for the diary with Laura's name embossed upon it. She pulls it out

window, GASPS.
Harold Smith stands on the other side of the glass, face distorted, now staring at her with
anger.

rips free from her grasp, shoves her toward Maddy and the hidden books.
Maddy and Donna stand together, breathless, afraid. Harold Smith pauses, just stares at them
for a beat Feels the black weight of their betrayal. Then, quietly, almost a whisper, he speaks:
HAROLD
Are you looking for secrets? Is that it? Maybe I can
give you one. Do you want to know what the
ultimate secret is? Laura did.

ACT ONE
FADE IN:
1.  PARKING LOT - DAY
SHERIFF TRUMAN angry and frustrated, walks with AGENT COOPER, HAWK, and
ALBERT ROSENFIELD through the hospital/morgue parking lot. It's early. A thick fog,
hangs in the air.
ALBERT
The short answer is it's the work of the same ghoul who
killed Laura.
(drops a cellophane container in Cooper's hands)
More fan mail. An "O" under Maddy's ring fingernail ...
(he gives another cellophane container to Cooper)
She had strands of fur clutched in her right hand.
COOPER
What kind of fur?
ALBERT
White fox. The strands are laced with formaldehyde.
A dead animal. Stuffed.
Truman's not listening. He's got the killer in custody, or so he thinks. Investigative details are
no longer his concern.
TRUMAN
I should make the calls. Leland will know how to get a
hold of Maddy's family -
COOPER
Don't. Don't call anybody. I need twenty-four hours.
TRUMAN
For what?
COOPER
(quiet, internal)
To finish this.
TRUMAN
(his frustration begins to show)
It is finished.
Stalemate. Albert intervenes, takes Cooper aside.

ALBERT
Cooper ... an observation?
COOPER
Yes, Albert.
ALBERT
I don't where this is headed, but the only one of us with
the coordinates for this destination in their hardware is
you. Lock in. Go on whatever Vision Quest you require,
stand on the rim of the volcano. Stand alone and do
your dance. Just find this beast before he takes another
bite.
(turns to Truman)
And perhaps you could follow behind him with a
buglight attached to a pith helmet.
Albert offers a snide farewell wave to Truman, peels off to his automobile. Cooper steps back
to Truman and Hawk.
COOPER
(to self, almost tenderly)
God help me, I don't know where to start.
Hawk puts a hand on his shoulder.
HAWK
You're on the path. You don't need to know where it
leads. Just follow.
Cooper looks at him. Then to Truman.
TRUMAN
(despite what he believes)
Good luck.

2.  DOUBLER DINER - DAY
DONNA HAYWARD sits in a booth in the morning sun, sipping coffee and working on her
homework. A smiling JAMES HURLEY enters passing by ERNIE NILES who sits at the
counter reading the sports page. Donna beams at James.
DONNA
I thought you'd never get here.

James smiles and gives Donna a morning-after kiss. He slides in across from Donna. Takes a
sip of her coffee.
JAMES
I went out for a ride this morning. Buried the needle.
The engine sounded like music, like hundreds of people
singing some huge song.
DONNA
(with affection)
What were they singing about?
JAMES
(in kind)
What do you think?
DONNA
(loving memory, not coy)
Last night. I could sing about last night.
James digs in his pocket and takes out a small gift-wrapped package.
JAMES
This is for you.
(hands it to Donna)
Open it.
Donna opens the box. Takes out a beautiful, but simple ring with the smallest of diamonds.
DONNA
Oh, James.
JAMES
I wasn't sure what size to get. The girl at the jewelry
store has these big hands so I had to guess ...
(taking her hand)
But I bet ...
He slides the ring on her finger, where one would wear a wedding band.
JAMES
(it fits)
Perfect.

Yeah. That okay with you?
DONNA
(re the ring, their lives, everything)
It's perfect.
James leans across the table, means to kiss her, the table and coffee between them. Donna
laughs, James grins. Then gathers her into his arms the best he can, offers a lasting kiss.

3. HANK JENNINGS
He slides up next to ERNIE who smiles watching Donna and James.
HANK
You ever in love in the joint, Ern?
Disgusted, Ernie goes back to his paper - the sports pages - trying to avoid Hank
HANK (CONTINUED)
Remember that fourth floor game room? Where the
boys did business? You played along or they tossed you
over the rail. Four floors down to the cement. Guy
landed it sounded like a cannon.
ERNIE
I'm not interested in whatever you're selling, Hank.
HANK
No, you got it backwards. You are interested, Ernie. I
got a piece of something North of the Border, little
gambling, some female company. Full service kind of
place. See, Ernie, the way I figure it, your speciality
being arithmatic -
ERNIE
I have an MBA from Wharton's -

HANK
Excuse me. Here's the deal. I want this operation to
grow. You're a guy who knows how to grease it. I'll need
your help. And a good-sized chunk of Vivian's do-reme. Kind of an "Inlaw Thing."
ERNIE
You're confusing "In-law with Inmate."
HANK
Either way we're talking about prison, aren't we?
ERNIE
Our commonality of wrongdoing has nothing to do with
true bonding.
HANK
No, you see it's just like being back in the jo 'Cause
we got a fourth floor on the outside, too.
Ernie tries to rise, Hank holds him firmly, moves closer, smiles.
HANK (CONTINUED)
Don't make me give you the rail, Ern.
Ernie is chilled by Hank's threat.

4. NORMA AND VIVIAN SMYTHE
Norma watches Ernie move away. Vivian sits in front of an omelette.
NORMA
They are up to something.
VIVIAN
Norma, Norma, Norma ... darling, let the scales fall
from your eyes.
(Norma looks at her)
The men you and I fall for are boys. My legacy to you,
I'm afraid, dear; strutting, adorable juveniles. We wipe
their noses, wash their underwear, tie their shoes -
NORMA
Hank was doing hard time, not juvenile detention.
VIVIAN
That may be. But wherever they find themselves the men
we love spend their life in the dark. And in Ernie's case,

She takes bite of the omelette. Points to it.
VIVIAN
Oh dear. Whatever fowl did you take these eggs from?
NORMA
Are we saying we don't like it?
VIVIAN
I'm afraid I'm going to hit a thumbtack.
NORMA
(frustration, near exploding)
Can't you say anything nice? Mother, I've tried so hard,
I try so hard and, and nothing's good enough for you; no,
let me correct that, nothing I do, I ever do is good
enough -
VIVIAN
(trying to be light)
The menu's are very presentable -
(sees the hurt)
I'm joking. Honestly, may I suggest something? If you
want to serve a truly memorable omelette, try some
white veal sausage with some morel mushrooms -
NORMA
(taking Vivian's plate and moving off)
Thanks. I'll go pick the mushrooms.

4A. DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN
Andy sits at the counter, feeling blue, ignoring the pie before him. He mutters a phrase to
himself, as if to test the words, perhaps commit them to memory.
ANDY
(terrible French)
J'ai une...J'ai une ame solitaire...
Big sigh. Somehow it makes Andy feel better. As Donna and James step toward the register,
he repeats, a little more confidentally:

Nothing. Hello, Donna and James.
DONNA

Tell me what you said.
ANDY
It's French.
DONNA
I know what it is. Tell me.
JAMES
Hey, it's no big deal.
ANDY

J'ai une ame solitaire.
DONNA

How do you know Mrs. Tremond?
ANDY

Mrs. Who?
DONNA
Mrs. Tremond. Her grandson does magic tricks. He
said this to me.
ANDY
But it was Mr. Smith.
DONNA

Harold ... ?

Andy nods, leans closer to impart a confidence.
ANDY
He left a suicide note. J'ai une, you know. It means I am
a lonely soul.
DONNA

I have to find Agent Cooper.
JAMES
Donna, what the hell is going on?
Donna turns for the door. James calls after, frustrated:
JAMES

5A.  MRS. TREMOND'S HOUSE - DAY
Donna leads Cooper and Andy up the path to Mrs. Tremond's house, directly across from
Harold Smith's. In mid-speech:
DONNA
Mrs. Tremond is the woman who told me about Harold
Smith. She has a grandson. And he said it to me. The
same words that were in Harold Smith's suicide note ...
COOPER
(ignoring Albert, suggesting a possibility)
Maybe the boy said the same thing to Harold.
DONNA
Harold's world was in words. The suicide note was a
message, it has to be. And it leads back here ...
Donna knocks on Mrs. Tremond's door. A long beat.
DONNA
(as if explain the delay)
She's pretty old. If her grandson isn't here to open it ...
ANDY

There's someone inside.

Just then: the door opens, revealing a WOMAN. Middle-aged. Pleasant in appearance. And
most decidedly not Mrs. Tremond.
WOMAN
(seeing Truman's badge)
May I help you ... ?
DONNA
(confused)
Is Mrs. Tremond here?
WOMAN
I'm Mrs. Tremond.
DONNA
Maybe it was your mother I spoke to.
TREMOND
(friendly)
My mother passed away three years ago. I live alone.
DONNA
No. I was here. I talked to her. And her grandson, he
was here too.
TREMOND
(confused, quietly apologetic)
But I have no children.
DONNA
But he was here. They were both here...
COOPER
(puts a comforting hand on her shoulder)
Donna, maybe we should go.
TREMOND
(recognizing the name)
Donna? Donna Hayward?
DONNA
(to Tremond)
Yes.
TREMOND
Just a moment ...
Mrs. Tremond goes back inside.

DONNA
I've never seen her before in my life.
COOPER
But you said you delivered meals here -
DONNA
I only went inside once. The first time. When the old
woman told me about Harold. I'm supposed to leave
them on the steps ...
Mrs. Tremond returns holding an envelope.
TREMOND
The morning after poor Harold died, I found this with
my mail. I meant to turn it in ...
(holding it up for them to see)
It's for you.
Mrs. Tremond holds the envelope toward Donna. Her name is written there.
DONNA
It's Harold's handwriting.
COOPER
Open it.
She does. Reveals a single page inside.
DONNA
(stunned, fearful)
It's Laura's diary; A page from her diary.
COOPER
(quietly intense)
Read it, Donna.
A long beat. Donna peering at the familiar handwriting. Finally, in a whisper.
DONNA
(reading with sadness, disbelief)
February 21st. Last night I had the strangest dream. I
was in a red room with a small man dressed in red and
an old man, sitting in a chair.
Cooper reacts. He had the same dream. Laura, the midget, forgotten secrets whispered in his
ear.
 DREAM

5A. CONTINUED:(3)
DONNA (CONTINUED)
I tried to talk to him. I wanted to tell him who Bob is
because I thought he could help me. But my words came
out slow and odd. It was so frustrating trying to talk. I
got up and walked over to the old man. Like I was
going to kiss him. Then I leaned over and whispered the
secret in his ear. I told him everything.
(beat)
Somebody has to stop Bob. Bob's only afraid of one
man. He told me once. A man named Mike. I wonder
if this was Mike in my dream. Even if it was only a
dream, I hope he heard me. No one in the real world
would believe me.
Donna completes the page, now turns to the other side. She reads:
DONNA
February 22nd. Tonight is the night that I die.
(quiet gasp, a look at Cooper)
I know I have to because it is the only way to keep Bob
away from me. The only way to tear him out from
inside. I know he wants me. I can feel his fire. But if I
die he can't hurt me anymore.
(Donna begins to weep)
I'm not afraid. I'll miss Donna and James. I'll miss my
home. But I'm tired and Bob won't let me rest. Death
will be like sleeping. I'm almost happy. And best of
all ... I'm free.
Donna looks up at Cooper, tears on her face. Andy's crying too. He puts his arm around her,
comforts her.
COOPER
Laura and I had the same dream. But in her dream I was
Mike.
ANDY
That's ... that's impossible.
COOPER
Yes, it is. Andy, take Donna home. I've got to find
Gerard.
Cooper moves off.

5C.  GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Cooper enters cautiously. PHILLIP GERARD, wheezing and barely conscious, lies without
bedclothes on a stripped mattress. DOC HAYWARD lays wet compresses on Gerard's
forehead. Cooper moves to Hayward.
DOC
He's completely dehydrated. Breathing getting more
difficult. He needs the drug.
Cooper moves to kneel beside Gerard.
COOPER
"Mike?" Mike, I need to speak to you.
DOC
Any longer could kill him.
A terrifying groan from Gerard.
COOPER
"Mike?"
Gerard opens his eyes, takes Cooper's hand, nods, weakly.
COOPER
There isn't much time. Bob has killed again.
Gerard winces, pained, looks away. Cooper brings him back.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
I'm close to knowing. But the last distance to close is
the most difficult. I need to know something. I need
you to help me.
Gerard nods, grasps his hand, eager to help.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
Bob was in my dream. So was Laura Palmer. So were
you. And Laura dreamt about me the night before she
died. The same dream. I need to go back there and
unlock my dream. The answer is inside.
He leans over him to hear. Gerard struggles with every word. Fighting to stay Mike.

COOPER

A golden circle ...
Gerard gives him the "OK" sign. Which triggers another thought for Cooper.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
A ring. My ring. I gave my ring to someone. The
Giant.
GERARD
He is known to us here.
COOPER
The Giant. Is he real?
GERARD
As real as I am. He can lead you to Bob.
COOPER
How?
GERARD
You have to ask him first.
COOPER
I'm sorry, I don't understand -
GERARD
You have all the clues you need. The answer's not here,
my friend.
(he gently touches Cooper's head)
The answer is here.
He touches Cooper's chest.
COOPER
I don't understand, please -
GERARD

Gerard goes slack in his arms. "Mike" is gone. Cooper holds Gerard's limp body. He looks

5D.  GREAT NORTHERN HALLWAY - DAY
Cooper exits Gerard's room. He stops to think. Behind him, around the corner comes the
world's oldest ROOM SERVICE WAITER. He's carrying a tray with a glass of milk. He
stops to look at Cooper. Cooper realizes he's being watch and turns.
WAITER
I know about you.
The Waiter winks at him. Cooper looks at him puzzled.
WAITER (CONTINUED)
That milk'll cool down on you, but it's getting warmer now.
The Waiter gives him a thumbs up and moves slowly along.
COOPER
(to himself)
... getting warmer now.
The Waiter turns once, gives him another thumbs up and disappears around the corner.

6.  BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
Sound of DISTANT THUNDER outside. A storm is approaching. Truman and a team of
deputies are methodically searching the room. Truman going through records at the desk.
TRUMAN

Box and tag everything in these drawers.
Cooper appears, pauses on the steps by the door.
TRUMAN (CONTINUED)
Coop. We found Horne's phone records.
(Truman moves to him)
Here it is. The night Laura died. The phone call Leland
told us about. Ben called her number from this office.
Cooper spots the STUFFED FOX in the office, walks to it, as if he was the only person in
the room. Examines the fur.
COOPER
White fox.

waterfall. He killed Laura and he killed Maddy, too.
Albert stands in the doorway from the inner office. He steps through the deputies to Cooper.
ALBERT

Madelaine Ferguson died night before last between ten
p.m. and midnight.
TRUMAN
Ben Horne was in custody by midnight.
ALBERT
That's as close as I can cut it.

Ben Horne's blood test.
Cooper glances at the information inside, hands paper to Albert. Albert peers at the results.
Then, gradually, hands them to Truman. HOLD ON Truman for a beat. His ambiguous
expression.

Cooper turns to Albert and Truman.
COOPER

LUCY
At first I thought you were the father. But then you said
you didn't have any sperms. Then I thought it was Dick.
But now you tell me your sperms are better so as far as I
can tell it's a fifty-fifty proposition.
Andy grabs the phone, begins to dial with grim determination.

Fashions. Yes, I'll hold.

You are in prison.

Snag?

The usual business disputes, delays. Unforeseen
difficulties, some legal in nature, others ... I'm not able

Tojomura-san, as you can see, I am incarcerated.
Falsely accused. My brother the boy-genius is out
looking for a better lawyer. And until justice is done,
until I am able to breathe the air that free men breathe ...

I plead with you for understanding. This is the long
dark night of my soul. A time to seek that tiny
flickering flame within. Business my God, I can hardly
consider it, let alone competently proceed with our
negotiations

Forgive me I've been rather emotional lately ...
Ben pauses. He'd cry if he could force a few measly tears from his ducts. A beat. Faint noise
from outside the cell. And last is a naked foot comes INTO VIEW, placed gently between
the bars, toenails painted a bright cherry red. Ben, head hanging, stares down at them. His
brain reels. He'd know those toes anywhere.
BEN

Ben looks up, amazed. Tojomura speaks in the VOICE of CATHERINE MARTELL.
CATHERINE/TOJOMURA

Benjamin Home, you're a slimey rat bastard. And I

existance a living hell. Despite which, I can't help

Because I will.

Catherine thrusts the contracts through the bars and smiles. Ben scribbles his signature upon
the contracts. Catherine slips her naked foot back into its shoe.

sealed, delivered ...

And so you'Il tell the Sheriff ...?

Leland scurries over to the stereo, sets needle to vinyl. An old thirties dance tune is HEARD.
He does a couple of soft shoe steps in Donna's direction. Then ... a KNOCK at the door.
LELAND
Wait right here.
Leland steps off to answer. He opens the door, Sheriff Truman man enters, brushes rain from
his coat. They converse quietly in the alcove. Donna remains out of sight.
LELAND
Harry.
TRUMAN
Leland, we need your help.
LELAND
What is it?
TRUMAN
I'm afraid there's been another murder.
LELAND
Oh my God. Oh my God, that's dreadful.
TRUMAN
Leland, we're closing in on Laura's killer. I can't tell
you why or how but we need your help and we need it
now.
LELAND
Of course. Certainly. Anything. Let me get my coat.

Leland grabs a jacket from a hanger nearby. He steps with Truman toward the door,
glancing briefly toward the living room, Donna left behind him.
Donna listens to the door slam. Her eyes bright with tears. There has been another murder.

13.  HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY
Doc Hayward works in his yard. He sighs, full of sadness.
DONNA
Dad?
Hayward looks up, sees Donna standing before him. Full of sorrow. And rage. Hayward gets
to his feet. A beat, then:
DONNA
It's Maddy, isn't it? She's dead.
HAYWARD
Let's not talk about it now.
DONNA
(she will not be comforted)
Tell me the truth.
HAYWARD
(pause)
I'm so sorry. Yes, she's...
DONNA
How?
HAYWARD
(as delicately as he can put)
Like Laura.
DONNA
No ... no ...
HAYWARD
Baby ...
Donna shudders with anger, overcome. Her father steps to her, tries to take Donna into his
arms. But Donna rips free from his grasp. She will not be comforted.
DONNA
NO! I am sick and tired of all this pain. Sick in my
heart. Everything good turns to bad. No matter what

Donna can't stand it. She turns and runs.

14.  THE ROADHOUSE - DAY
Establish. The storm now grips the region. Thunder and lightning in the dark sky.

15.  THE ROADHOUSE -DAY
Truman and Leland walk through the Roadhouse interior. Cooper and Albert are sitting at
the bar. The mood is dreamlike, eerie. And will remain so throughout the following,
punctuated by the sound of the storm outside.
LELAND
Why are we here? Agent Cooper? Is someone meeting
us?
COOPER
Yes.
LELAND
The killer?
COOPER
I don't know. Perhaps.
The main door opens. Big Ed Hurley enters; Ed looks about, a little confused.
ED

LELAND
Of course.
ALBERT
(aggresively cheerful)
Only too happy to help.
Cooper hefts a chair, moves it from the center of the room. Ed, Hawk, Albert and Leland
grab chairs, slide them toward the walls. Cooper returns to push at a table.
ED
(aside to Cooper, his real reason for being here)
You need me, just give the word.
Ed gives the Bookhouse Boys sign.
SHELLY JOHNSON wheels LEO JOHNSON into the room. Muttering, Bobby Briggs is
led in by Hawk.
BOBBY
Give yourself a raise, Hawk.
COOPER
Bobby, wheel Leo to the bar and be very, very quiet. Do
you read me?
Bobby sighs, wheels Leo as directed.
Cooper clears the last table to the side. There is now a large open space at the center of the
room. Cooper turns to regard it, checks his watch as if expecting someone else. All eyes are
upon him. Ed and the others watch Cooper with varying degrees of confusion.
The main door OPENS, Truman escorts Ben Horne inside. All turn to view him.
BEN
(a pause, cold)
Hail, hail, the gang's all here.
Truman leads Ben to the others. Cooper turns to address the group.

COOPER
(finishes, turns to the group)
Two days ago, another young woman was murdered by
the indivudual responsible for the death of Laura Palmer.
I have reason to believe the killer is inside this room.
Some react with looks of disbelief - followed by glances at the men next to them. BEN
keeps a cold eye on Cooper.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
As a Federal Agent I spend most of my time seeking
simple answers to difficult questions. In pursuit of
Laura's killer, I have used Bureau guidelines, deductive
technique, Tibetan method, instinct and luck. But now I
find myself in need of something new. Which, for lack
of a better word, we will call magic.
Pause. Cooper looks at the door, at his watch. The suspects stand together, nervous,
uncertain.
BEN
Would you like us to hum? Perhaps some pagan chant ...
Truman and Albert move to Cooper.
ALBERT
(quiet, cheerful)
I think it's going terrifically well, don't you?
TRUMAN
Now what?
COOPER
I'm not completely sure. Someone's missing.
TRUMAN
Who?
ALBERT
Brian, the leprechaun king?
LIGHTNING AND THUNDER. Cooper looks at the suspects. He looks at his watch. He
peers at the large clock above the bar; it strikes three o'clock. Three soft resonant bongs.
A noise from the Roadhouse entrance, the door opens, light pours into the room. Cooper
pivots to see the familiar silhouette of MAJOR BRIGGS. Accompanied by the Room
Service Waiter.
BRIGGS
Excuse us ...

COOPER
(with a small smile of relief)
Major, you're right on time.
BRIGGS
I was on my way home. This kind gentleman flagged
me down, asked if I could drive him here.
Cooper and the Waiter look at each other. The Waiter winks at him. Gives him a thumbs up.
Takes out a pack of gum and extends the pack. Cooper takes out a stick. There's a lightning
bolt on the wrapper. Cooper puts the stick in his mouth. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING.
BEN
(sees the pack)
I know that gum. Thar's the kind I used to chew when I
was a kid. That's my favorite gum in the world.
WAITER
(a big smile)
That gum you like is going to come back in style.
Time stands still.

16. COOPER'S DREAM
Cooper is back in a dream. He looks down. On the roadhouse floor, a familiar mound of
dirt appears at his feet. Something gold gleams inside it: Laura's heart necklace. But the
heart is no longer halved, both pieces are joined. The heart shimmers, disappears:
Out of it the fabric of his vision tears, shifts. And Cooper finds himself back in a familiar red
room. The dream first seen in episode #1.002. Cooper sits in the armchair, mute. Laura leans
close to him, smiling. She whispers. But this time Cooper hears and comprehends ...
LAURA
Ben Horne killed me.
A FLASH OF LIGHTNING.

We're back in the roadhouse. The GIANT appears holding Cooper's ring in the palm of his
hand. In the same brilliant flash of light, the Giant disappears and Cooper's ring falls out of
the air, bounces and rolls to a stop at Cooper's feet. He bends to pick it up. Slips it on his
finger. We MOVE in on him. A long beat. Then, quiet, stern, Cooper turns toward Ben
Horne.
COOPER
Ben, I would like you to accompany me to the Sheriff's
station. You might want to bring Leland with you. As
your attorney.
Cooper nods to Truman. The Sheriff cuffs a stunned Ben Horne and leads him away. Deputy
Hawk steps to Cooper.

HAWK
The quest is over?
COOPER

One thing more.
Hawk leans to receive his whisper. Hawk walks to the door. Cooper follows at first and then
stops. He looks back towards the stage. He sees the Room Service Waiter wave at him and
smile.

17.  GAZEBO - DAY
James rides up on his bike, hops off as Donna runs to him, hugs him, quietly hysterical.
Evidence recent rain all about them.
JAMES
What is it? What's the matter?
DONNA
Maddy ...
JAMES
What about her?
DONNA
She's dead. It was the killer. The one who killed
Laura. She's dead.
Stunned, he moves away. His legs give way near the shore. Donna watches him helplessly.
JAMES
No ... no ...
DONNA
(unfocused rambling)
I heard Mr. Palmer get a call from her, from her
mother, she said she hadn't gotten home, they came to
talk to him, Sheriff Truman and so I went home, my
father he was so upset he couldn't keep it from me ...
She starts to cry. They can't comfort each other.

You mean us?
JAMES
We can't do this. It's no good.
DONNA
What did we do? What did we do?
Pause.
JAMES
I've got to go. I've got to go.
He starts for his bike.
DONNA
James, don't leave ... it's not our fault!
JAMES
It doesn't matter. Don't you see? Nothing we do
matters. Nothing's ever going to change. It doesn't
matter if we're happy when the rest of the world goes to
hell -
DONNA
Don't leave - James - don't leave me alone!
He gets on his bike and rides. Anguished, Donna turns toward the lake, weeping, stepping
slowly into the water.

Tremayne enters to discover Andy sitting at one end of the table. Tremayne sits opposite
him. Lucy moves to a seat halfway between them. They all look at each other. High Noon.

Doors swing open. Hawk leads Ben in. Leland, Cooper, and Truman follow.
COOPER

Let's take him back down to interrogation.
Hawk leads Ben off. Truman follows.

Cooper moves off. Leland follows.

22.  DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY
In the basement, around the corner from interrogation. Hawk leads Ben towards the door, as
Truman moves ahead to unlock it. Cooper and Leland follow them around the corner.
Truman unlocks the door, swings it open. Hawk grabs Ben from behind, moves him
forcefully into interrogation.
The moment Ben realizes he is locked in, he begins to howl like a caged wolf. Truman slams
the door shut, Hawk locks it.
The howling continues, a rabid sound; Ben, or rather "Bob", careens around the room,
pounding on the walls, searching for an escape that doesn't exist, his incoherent cries echoing
like the tortures of the damned.
Leland stands by, stunned, speechless.
LELAND
(the rest implied)
... Ben? ...
HAWK
(watching through the grill)
That's not Ben.
A gesture from Cooper and Hawk leads Leland back around the corner.

Truman, Hawk, Albert and Cooper face Ben, sitting in a chair, handcuffs in front of him..
TRUMAN

- you have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford
an attorney one will be appointed for you ...
Ben begins to laugh, a low, feral sound, snarling and contemptuous.
TRUMAN (CONTINUED)
Do you understand your rights as we've explained them
to you?
BEN
Of course he does.
(a beat)
I suppose you want to ask him some questions.
COOPER
Did you kill Laura Palmer?
Ben hoots and howls. Then ...
BEN
That's a yes.
COOPER
Did you kill Madeleine Ferguson?
BEN
What do you think?
COOPER
I'm asking you.
BEN

Yeah, well, I guess I sort'a did, kind'a. I have a thing

Cooper pales.
BEN (CONTINUED)
Ben's been a good vehicle. I've enjoyed the ride. But
he's weak now and riddled with holes. It's nearly time
to shuffle off to Buffalo.
TRUMAN
Does Ben know what you've done?
BEN
Ben's a babe in the woods. With a large hole where his
conscience used to be. And when I go, children, I'll pull
the ripcord and you watch Ben remember. But not for
long ...
He laughs again wildly then stops with a jerk. His eyes close. "Bob" seems to be resting or
waiting. Truman and Cooper look at each other.
TRUMAN
That's good enough for me.
The group exits the room quietly.

23.  CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Lucy faces both Tremayne and Andy. Tremayne reaches nervously for a cigarette.
LUCY
Here's how this is going to work. I'm going to keep my
baby.
TREMAYNE
Oh?
LUCY
That's not open for discussion.
TREMAYNE

Tremayne lights his cigarette with a lighter, speaks to Lucy.
TREMAYNE

LUCY
There's only one way to handle this. They have a test to
determine the blood type of the father. It could be you
or it could be you.
Tremayne looks Andy up and down.
LUCY (CONTINUED)
They won't be doing that test until the baby is born.
During which time I expect complete cooperation from
you two "gentlemen."
TREMAYNE
Whatever you say, Lucy. I mean, it's your baby.
LUCY

Thank you.
The smoke from Tremayne's cigarette drifts lazily up to the ceiling. Towards the newly
installed smoke detector.

Hawk continues to monitor Ben thru the window. Cooper speaks urgently. Takes a piece of
paper from his pocket hands it to Truman.
COOPER

TRUMAN
Why? Why did he kill her?
COOPER
Laura wrote about Bob in her diary; Ben found it, ripped
out the pages and she knew he was onto her. Ben placed
that call to Laura from Ben's office the night she died.
He was the Third man outside Jacques' cabin. He took
both girls to the train car. It was his blood we found,
not Ben Horne's.
TRUMAN
Then why kill Maddy?
COOPER
She reminded him of Laura. Maddy was going home,
maybe he couldn't bear to part with her. He wanted to
relive the experience. Or maybe she realized Bob was
the killer and he found out.
TRUMAN
But there can't really be a "Bob." I mean Ben's just
crazy Isn't he?
Truman, Hawk, Cooper and Albert look at each other. Ben's howls fill the air.
ALBERT
Shall we take a vote?
From inside the room they hear Ben's voice.

As it climaxes, the electronic wail of a smoke alarm is heard.

Cooper and the others look up; he's directly under the nozzle of a sprinkler head. The
sprinkler heads spit water and start to rain. The corridor is filled with rain.

26B.  INTERROGATION ROOM DAY
With a terrifying, howl Ben/Bob bolts up from his seat and howls at the rain. Then he rushes
for the door ramming his head into it. He's knocked senseless, blood coming from a gash on
his head.
The foursome sprint into the room. Cooper rushes to Ben, wet and still on the ground,
water continuing to fall in this room.
COOPER
(assessing Ben's wound)
Call an ambulance.
Hawk rushes out of the room. Cooper gathers Ben in his arms. Truman, Albert stand by.

Ben spasms, a seizure gripping him. Albert helps Cooper restrain him, pulling his tongue
from down his throat. It subsides. Ben moans, as his eyes reopen.
BEN
The shadow ... he's gone ... I ... I remember ...
(the images flood back)
Oh, my God ... Laura ...

I killed her ... oh my God, I killed her ... I didn't
know, I didn't know ... Laura, darling, forgive me ...
COOPER
It's all right. It's all right.
BEN
I was just a little boy. I saw him in my dreams. He
said he wanted to play ...

inside me ...
COOPER.

He went inside.
BEN
When he was in me, I didn't know ... when he was gone, I
couldn't remember ... he made me do things ... terrible
things ... he wanted life ... he wanted others, others they
could use, the way they used me ...
COOPER
Laura?
BEN
They wanted Laura ... they wanted her, but she was strong
... she fought them, she wouldn't let them in ... they
made me kill that girl, Theresa, they said if I didn't
give Laura to them they'd make me kill her too ...

She said she'd die before she'd let them ... they made
me kill her ... God have mercy on me, what have I done?
What have I done? I love her ... I loved her with all my
heart ...
COOPER
Be quiet now. Lie quiet.
BEN
Laura, forgive me ... ...
Ben is fading. Albert checks him out, looks at Cooper, shakes his head. Cooper turns BEN
gently so that he's lying on his right side, holds him and begins to speak softly in his ear. The
Tibetan Book of the Dead.
COOPER
Ben, the time has come for you to seek the Path. Your
soul has set you face to face before the clear light ... and
now you are about to experience it in its Reality, wherein
all things are like the void and cloudless sky, and the
naked, spotless intellect is like a transparent vaccum,
without circumference or center ...
Ben's face calms. His eyes clear. Albert and Truman watch, electrified.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
At this moment, know yourself and abide in that state ...
(gently places two fin gers on his carotid artery)
Look towards the light, Ben, look towards the light.
BEN

closes Ben's eyes. Above them, water stops flowing from the sprinklers.

A short time later. Truman, Cooper and Albert step through the pines. As if to seek refuge in
the rain-fresh air. Major Briggs is standing in a clearing.
TRUMAN
He was insane. Schizophrenic. Gerard too.

ALBERT

How did you see him?
BRIGGS

That question may require a bit more self-examination.
TRUMAN
I've lived in these woods all my life. I've heard some
strange things. Seen some too. But this is way off the
map. I'm having a hard time believing.
COOPER
Is it easier to believe a man would rape and murder his
own daughter? Is that any more comforting?
TRUMAN
(pause, horrified)
No.
BRIGGS
An evil that great in this beautiful world. Finally, does
it matter what the cause?
COOPER
Yes. Because it's our job to stop it.
Briggs thinks, agrees, nods.
ALBERT
Maybe that's all "Bob" is. The evil that men do.
Maybe it doesn't matter what we call it.
Pause. No one seems to disagree.
TRUMAN
Well. There's another thing that bothers me.

Today I bury my husband. Next to my only child. Her
grave is still fresh. There's just a little bit of grass on it.
She stops, numb with grief. Cooper leans in.
COOPER
Mrs. Palmer, there are things dark and heinous in this
world. Things too horrible to tell our children. Your
husband fell victim to one of them. Long ago, when he
was innocent and trusting. Leland didn't commit these
crimes. Not the Leland you knew.

Thank you very much.
Hank pauses to receive her gratitude, then looks up, reacts. BIG ED HURLEY and NORMA
JENNINGS stand together across the room. Talking quietly, sharing some confidence.
Hank scowls, watches as Norma steps away. Then returns to the buffet.
AUDREY

Do you invite people to these things or do they just show
up?
EILEEN
At a time like this people just naturally come together.
It is a time of reaching out. I remember when my mother
died there must have been a hundred people.
SARAH

promised they'd be best friends for life. A bond against
dying ...
Eileen reacts - feeling bad for bringing this up.
SARAH (CONTINUED)
No, please, I want to remember. Donna spent the night

was fine.
EILEEN

Eileen takes Sarah's hand, and squeezes it - two mothers loving their daughters.

ED
C'mon, Donna, honey. He'll come back soon.
Everything's gonna get better.
Nadine rushes over, agitated.
NADINE
Excuse me, Eddie.

Can you see my underpants in my shoes?
Ed's completely flummoxed. He looks at her gleaming shoes.
NADINE (Cont'd)
I looked down and thought I could see the reflection. Do
you think boys have been looking up my dress?
ED
Sweetheart, I can't see a thing in your shoes. I promise.
Satisfied, Nadine returns to the coffee machine. Donna gives Ed a sympathetic look.

DOUGIE
You're just jealous.

Dwayne manages a swift kick to Dougie's shin. Dougie yelps, and finally lets go of the ear.
TRUMAN
Dougie, Mr. Mayor, gentlemen, I'll ask you to please
remember where you are. And why we're here.
The brothers go in opposite directions - in a huff, Doc walks over to Cooper and Pete, who
were watching this.
COOPER
Extraordinary display.
PETE
The Mayor and his brother. Dougie owns the newspaper.
They've had a running feud for about fifty years.
DOC
Nobody knows how it started. Something about an old
flame and a rumble seat. I'm not even sure they
remember anymore.
PETE
The nest's a little stirred up right now. Dougie's engaged
to be married. To a babe.
DOC
For the fifth time.
PETE
She's twenty-two. He's seventy-eight. Kind of a JanuaryDecember thing.

NORMA is behind the counter setting up for the day, VIVIAN helping, laying out napkins.
Norma catches a look at herself in the MIRROR - then pinches her cheeks to give them color.
VIVIAN
You look marvelous. Suffering must agree with you.
NORMA
Why do you assume I'm suffering?
VIVIAN
This business. Your marriage. It's hard on a body, trying
to do what you're doing.
NORMA
This is my life.
VIVIAN
That's the point I'm trying to make.
Norma starts to respond to this latest affront when HANK and ERNIE walk through the front
door, all decked out in hunting gear, carrying rifles, which Hank is using to demonstrate.
HANK
The sight on yours drifts left; just aim a shade right -
VIVIAN
Behold the Great White Hunter. Try not to shoot
yourself in the foot, dear.
ERNIE
(defending his manhood; lying)
Darling, I used to shoot skeet. Didn't I tell you? I was
collegiate champion in the Little Ivy League.
HANK
We're after bigger game today.
NORMA

When did this little junket come up?

GREEGE
She's certainly trying to recapture that old school spirit.
JACOBY
A classic case of clinical regression. Mr. Greege, what's
important here is that Nadine be allowed to maintain her
own reality. Being eighteen is all she can manage. And it
could be a lot worse. Be glad she's not napping in a crib.
Ed shudders. Greege reaches his decision.
GREEGE
We will admit her under one condition: she has to
perform like a regular student. Ed, my advice to you is
can forget hot dinners. Nadine'll be busy doing her
homework like every other senior.
Ed nods. Grimaces. Another body blow.

AUDREY

COOPER
And you were involved in a case I was working on.

No. Someone was hurt by me. And I will never let that
happen again.
AUDREY

What happened, did they die or something?
COOPER
As a matter of fact she did. Would you like to know how?
(after a beat, she looks away; trying to shock)
She was a material witness to a federal crime. We were
supposed to protect her. Twenty-four hours a day.
Myself and my partner, the man who taught me
everything I know about being a special agent. I fell in
love with her. And when the attempt on her life was
finally made I wasn't ready. Because I loved her. She
died in my arms. I was badly wounded. And my
partner, Windom Earle was his name, lost his mind. Do
you need me to be more specific?

Okay Audrey. It's a deal.
With as much dignity as she can muster, she walks to the door, opens it and turns back to him.

BOBBY
It's big - but it's bad.
He looks over at Shelly, wearing sweatpants and a man's shirt - tired and depressed.
SHELLY
Leo just got that suit. Fits him a little tighter.

there. I took a gun. That girl, what was her name?
TRUMAN
Shelly Johnson.
CATHERINE
(a memory steeped in melodrama)
She was tied up inside. A bomb went off. The rest is
just impressions, walls of fire crashing, screams. I have
no idea how I escaped. I came to in the woods. Afraid
for my life. More afraid than I've ever been. I dragged
myself through the dark for what seemed like forever,
not even sure if I was dead or alive. As the sky
lightened, things began to look familiar. The woods. A
path. A rock formation. I was flooded with memories
of my childhood. And I thought, well, this is what
heaven is. That's when I saw our old summer cabin in the
distance. I'd walked twenty miles through the night.
Heaven was Pearl Lakes. And only a guardian angel
could have brought me there.
Catherine pauses to wipe the tears from her eyes. Truman leans to grab a box of tissues.
Occupied, he doesn't see the brief sneer pass across Catherine's features.
CATHERINE
(taking a tissue)
Thank you.
(resuming her artful tale of woe)
We always kept a well-stocked pantry. I went in and
opened a can of tuna fish. And I waited for whoever it
was who had tried to kill me to come and finish the job.
No phone, no newspaper, no television. I tended my
wounds, a loaded gun at my side, terrified that each
moment might be my last.
TRUMAN
(swept away in spite of himself)
Why did you come back?
CATHERINE
(after a beat)
I ran out of tuna fish.
A little bit of the old Catherine bleeds through. Sarcasm and superiority. Truman takes a
closer look. Wonders just what she's really thinking. Where she's really been.

LUCY
What are you doing here?
TREMAYNE
I wanted to see you. I wanted - to be honest, I wanted to
talk about our bambino.
LUCY
Our bambino?
TREMAYNE
Lucy, I've been in a gnarly turmoil and do you know
what I've discovered? I, Dick Treymayne, am a terrible,
crashing bore. And what I desperately require in my life
is something, no, someone more important than myself to
think about, to care for. So perhaps you see why that
as a result, I must say, parenthood suddenly appeals to me.
LUCY
Parenthood?
TREMAYNE
Fatherhood, more specifically. And since I have no skills
in this area, nurturing is a relatively foreign concept, I've
enlisted myself in the "Happy Helping Hand" program;
part-time big brother to some adorable, homeless waif.
LUCY
Excuse me, are you the Dick Treymayne who works at
Horne's department store?
HAWK walks through reception, glaring at Tremayne.
TREMAYNE
Yes. And, Lucy, by the way, I have absolute confidence
that the child is mine.
Hawk makes a face, sickened. He rounds the corner, and runs smack into DEPUTY ANDY,

her when she had a bun in the oven. And until we know for
sure who's gonna be throwing that baseball, or building
that doll house we should all be friends.

So you two go right talk, and I'll see ya.
Lucy and Treymayne stare at each other. Andy backs out of reception and into the hall -
practically collapsing into Hawk's arms.

Andy are you crazy?
ANDY
Hawk, I know Lucy, and I know what'll get her. M orals

You think I went too far?
They straighten up as Cooper enters past them, carrying fishing gear and goes into Truman's
office.

Truman's making some notes, when Cooper walks in. Truman stands up, smiling.
COOPER

of steelhead trout out there with my name on 'em.
TRUMAN
That's why I figure you're gonna be needing this.
Truman picks the PAPER BAG off his desk, and hands it to Cooper; awkward with the

To gather information about the murder of Laura Palmer,

HARDY
Who you apparently lured back across the border, where
he was wounded during arrest and subsequently murdered
that night in the hospital.
COOPER
Renault was a material witness to Laura's murder. Leland
Palmer confessed to Jacques' murder, which I believe he
commited to prevent Renault from ever testifying against
him. Are you judging me responsibile for that?
Coooper looks at the Mountie. He takes TWO PHOTOGRAPHS out of a manilla envelope
and tosses them in the middle of the table: one of BLACKIE'S DEAD BODY, the other of
DEAD EMORY BATTIS.
MOUNTIE
Let's talk about your second visit ...
COOPER
To rescue Audrey Horne from her kidnappers.
MOUNTIE
Who both ended up dead.
Hardy gives Mountie a look - he'll handle this.
HARDY
You know procedure. Crossing the border without
contacting Canadian authorities is a serious breach.
Under any circumstances.

21. CONTINUED:
COOPER
I'm not disputing that. Is it the Bureau's position I'm
responsibile for these deaths?
HARDY
That's what we're trying to determine. This entire
matter has been brought to our attention because Mountie
King was in the middle of a sting operation to nail this
man, Jean Renault.
A photograph of Jean Renault is displayed.
MOUNTIE
We worked six months to set this up; one night you march
in, Renault escapes, these two are dead and the cocaine we
were using to set him up is stolen from the premises.
COOPER
I don't know anything about cocaine. But you've
miscounted; three people were killed., Jean Renault
killed Blackie, I didn't know until now about the Battis
murder. And a bodyguard who turned his gun on me was
killed in self-defense.
Hardy looks at the Mountie - who's been thrown by this.
HARDY
So we've got crossing jurisdictional borders, three dead
bodies and international trafficking of drugs.
COOPER
Roger, I admit to the border crossing. You already know
the extent of my involvement with the killings. I hope
you know me better than to suspect I'd have any part of a
drug transaction.
HARDY
(eyes boring holes)
I won't know that until you prove it, Cooper. I will tell
you DEA's been called in to investigate. And you've got
twenty-four hours to assemble your defense; in the
meantime I'll require that you surrender your gun and
badge.
Pause. Cooper removes his GUN from the shoulder holster, and lays it on the table. From his
shirt pocket he produces the case containing his BADGE, places it next to his gun. Hardy nods
to the Mountie; he opens the door, summons Truman in, who's waiting just outside. Truman
sees Cooper's badge and gun. Cooper stands, smiles at Harry. He walks out, head high.

HARDY
(motioning to a chair)
Sheriff, I'll need to ask you a few questions.
TRUMAN
I'll stand.
HARDY
Let me begin by saying that whatever Agent Cooper is
guilty of will not be held against you; your cooperation
will be very useful - and greatly appreciated by the FBI.
TRUMAN
If I understand the law correctly, you (to Mountie)
need extradition papers in order to get a statement from
me. And you (to Hardy) need a subpeona from a judge.
Unless either of you have the appropriate paperwork -
you can take my cooperation and stuff It.
HARDY
That attitude will not serve you or Agent Cooper -
TRUMAN
It's not an attitude, it's a promise. I've had nothing, but
respect for the FBI since the day Cooper walked into my
office. He's the finest law man I've ever known; check
that, the finest man period. I don't know what
information you have or where you got it from, but I can
tell you this ... it's dead wrong
Truman turns on his heels and walks out.

22.  HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY
CLOSE ON an animated TEENAGE GIRL'S FACE - cheering.
CHEERING GIRL
STEEPLEJACKS, STEEPLEJACKS, ROLL 'EM!!!!
ANOTHER ANGLE reveals CHEERLEADING TRYOUTS. Nadine is next in the line of
AUDITIONING GIRLS. The P.E. TEACHER and Vice Principal Greege sit behind a
table, judging. Behind them hangs a BANNER for the "Twin Peaks Steeplejacks".
TWO WRESTLERS work out in another corner of the gym, under the WRESTLING
COACH'S supervision.
The Cheering Girl finishes off with a big jump in the air, touching both toes. The Pep Squad

NADINE

Permission?
P.E. TEACHER

NADINE

TWO GIRLS in the line snicker. Greege intervenes.
GREEGE

Nadine brightens.
P.E. TEACHER
Alright, Nadine, let's start you off with tumbling
Nadine bounces over to center stage. A MALE CHEERLEADER stands by to spot her. He
rolls his eyes - condescending. Nadine, grinning ear-to-ear, walks backwards. Further and
further, as if this were her routine. We HEAR a few laughs.
With a little jump, she starts running forward, and does a FRONT FLIP, followed by another
FRONT DOUBLE FLIP, into a series of CARTWHEELS, landing right in front or the
aghast MALE CHEERLEADER. She picks him up by his waist and tosses him into the air.
NADINE
Corkscrew!
And he indeed SPINS through the air, across the gym, landing on the matt on top of the
wrestlers. The Coach looks from the hapless cheerleader over to Nadine - very impressed.
Nadine beams proudly, barely out of breach.

SHELLY (CONTINUED)
Johnson's Nursing Home.
(listening, hurt)
Well that's just great, Bobby. I'm glad things went so
well. This must've been the longest meeting, in history.
CAMERA MOVES down, shooting Shelly through the spokes of Leo's wheelchair.
SHELLY (CONTINUED)
Yes, I still love you. Bobby, I've been thinking, we're
really gonna have to put Leo somewhere - in a home.
The wheel of Leo's chair turns one full revolution, rolling slowly through the frame, and stops.
SHELLY (CONTINUED)
It's not worth it. I don't want the money. I want a life.
Shelly turns and starts to sit; stops, looking at Leo. Something's wrong, but she can't place it.
SHELLY (CONTINUED)
Bobby, I think he moved. I swear, Leo moved.
(listening)
Okay, maybe I am losing my mind. That's what I've
been trying to tell you. Get over here tomorrow, first
thing. Please. Bye, lover.
Shelly hangs up, and goes over to Leo - the foam still hanging from his mouth - looking quite
mad. Shelly looks at where she thought the chair was, and where it is now. Could it be? She
shakes her head. A long day. Shelly moves around in front of Leo, peering cautiously into his
eyes.
SHELLY
Leo Johnson, are you in there?
Nothing. Shelly turns away, reaching for a towel. As Leo BLOWS A BUBBLE.

Cooper sits in a booth, drinking coffee, and studying a small PORTABLE CHESS BOARD,
wearing jeans and a flannel shirt. Truman walks in, relieved to see Cooper, sits opposite.
TRUMAN
Who are you playing, with?
COOPER
Windom Earle. A formidable opponent.
Cooper moves his pawn, then writes his move down on a piece of paper. He puts the note in an
ENVELOPE, already addressed to Windom Earle, Personals Dept., USA TODAY.
TRUMAN
I've been looking all over for you.
COOPER
I went to the library. Took a walk. I got hungry.
TRUMAN
What was at the library?
COOPER
William O. Douglas. A man from this neck of the
woods, and one of the great ministers of justice. I was
seeking, inspiration and I found it there.
TRUMAN
Preparing your defense?
COOPER
Yes. Douglas said in times of trouble a man should
immerse himself in wilderness. I'm going fishing.
(rises, lays his money on the counter)
You know, Harry, somewhere between William
Douglas and the Dalai Lama lies the perfect man.
Their attention is drawn to Norma, angrily folding up all the tableclothes and dumping them
in a box behind the counter.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
Norma appears to be quite upset this evening.
TRUMAN

COOPER
Harry, you're aces. Excuse me.

Norma? You know what they say? A critic is a legless
man who teaching running.
NORMA

Did you read it?
COOPER
It doesn't matter; you couldn't keep people out of here if
you tried.
NORMA
You're very nice, to say so. Thanks.

Harry, is it hunting season?
TRUMAN
Not unless they've switched months on the calender.
Norma chews that over. Cooper and Truman exit.
COOPER
Harry, it's time to put that Green Butt Skunk to work.
They exit, passing Vivian just entering. She moves to Norma at the cash register.
VIVIAN

care if anyone else ever comes here again. And they won't;
not after "if you're looking for local color stop in, but for
good food - give this one a wide berth."
VIVIAN
It said "local charm," not color.
NORMA
What did you do, memorize the piece of crash?
VIVIAN
No. I wrote it.
Pause.
VIVIAN (CONTINUED)
You might as well know so we can get this particular
melodrama over with. M. T. Wentz, c'est moi.
NORMA
I can't belive it. Is that why you came to visit. To run
me into the ground?
VIVIAN
Norma, darling, I wanted to write a good review, but it's
just not a good restaurant. I can't violate my professional
ethics -
NORMA
Ethics? I'm your daughter -
VIVIAN
Some standards have to prevail over -
NORMA
What about standards for common decency? Kindness?
Or don't those fall within the standards of your
"profession" -
VIVIAN
Of course they do -

No, the proof's in the pudding. Even if you find it
inedible. I wouldn't treat a dog like this, much less my

VIVIAN
Dear, be sensible -
NORMA
I am being sensible. Leave this place, now and get out of
my life. I 'm not going to lei you hurt me anymore.
VIVIAN
Norma -
NORMA
Goodbye. Go.
She stares at her. Vivian grows cold and leaves. Norma pours herself a cup of coffee. Tears
fall, her hands shake, rattling the cup but she knows she turned a corner.

Hank and Ernie, still in hunting attire with rifles, are escorted in by a couple of PICK-UPS.

Jean enters silently. He looks at Ernie, not liking what he sees.

Ernie, meet Jean Renault. Met him in the woods one

Jean, this is the Professor. What he can do with numbers
could make a thousand dollar hooker blush like a nun.
JEAN

A recent investment opportunity fell through, leaving us
in a cash-poor position. We need $125,000. Immediately.
ERNIE
(realizing the fix he's in; lying)
I understand completely.
JEAN
Do you, Professor?
ERNIE
(inspired lying)
This, this will not be difficult. Just so you know a little
bit more about me, I've been associated with a number
of the most prestigious financial institutions in the
country; I've laundered massive amounts of money, I've
brokered tremendously large deals for the Columbian

Ernie's eyes bug out. Hank pats him on the back.

You can handle this puny little load, can't you Ernie?
JEAN

He'll take care of it for us - won't you Professor?
ERNIE
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

27.  HARRY TRUMAN'S - NIGHT
A SOUND outside. Truman sits bolt up right in bed. He listens. Hears footsteps. He takes
his pistol from the holster hanging on the headboard, moves cautiously towards the door in the
darkness. He sees a shadow of movement outside the window against a curtain. Then a rattle
at the door, someone trying the handle.
Hefting the gun, Truman moves to the door, stands to the side, then pulls the door open
inwards. JOSIE PACKARD falls into the room, into his arms. She's exhausted, faint, a
wound on her forehead.
TRUMAN
Josie ...
JOSIE
Help me ...
She slips into unconsciousness. He holds her.

13.  CAMPSITE - NIGHT
Surrounded by towering Douglas Firs, Cooper and Major Briggs sit by their campfire -
putting MARSHMALLOWS on sticks. FISHING GEAR dries against a tree. The remains
of their dinner, TROUT BONES and HEADS, lay on tin plates.
COOPER
Major this is a fascinating concept. The other side of
love is not hate - but fear?

MAJOR BRIGGS
Absolutely. And fear is the absence of love.
COOPER
For yourself as well.
MAJOR BRIGGS
All perceptions or conditions must begin with the self.
They put their marshmallows over the fire.
COOPER
So when I let fear into my life, I'm not loving myself.
MAJOR BRIGGS
You are in direct contradiction to a state of loving
acceptance; incapable of it. Direct denial.
COOPER
Major Briggs, if I may ask a personal question ... do you
love yourself?
MAJOR BRIGGS
Very much.
Cooper's fascinated. He rotates his marshmallow in the fire.
COOPER
Then it stands to reason that Leland Palmer didn't.
MAJOR BRIGGS
One could draw that conclusion. There are powerful
forces of evil in the world. It is some men's fate to
confront great darkness. We each choose how to react. If
the choice is fear, then we become vulnerable to darkness.
Cooper looks around, at the literal darkness surrounding him.
COOPER
Tomorrow I face my own demons, Major Briggs. But,
thanks to you, I believe I will do so without fear. I
carefully considered my actions before proceeding. I
went forward. I must accept the consequences.
MAJOR BRIGGS
You can do no more.

I have pondered the some question continuously since this
horror was revealed to us.
COOPER
I try to imagine him, "it", out there somewhere, lurking.
Searching for prey. Terrible.
MAJOR BRIGGS
Yes. But remember, we have a choice; to think about it in
that way, to fear it, imparts power to evil. There are ways
to resist. You, Sir, are blessed with certain gifts. In this
respect you are not alone. Have you ever heard of the
White Lodge?
COOPER
(takes a bite of marshmellow)
The White Lodge. No.
MAJOR BRIGGS
Excuse me, mine is now seared to perfection.
Briggs pops the whole blackened marshmallow into his mouth. Cooper rises.
COOPER
I'll be right back, Major. Call of nature. There's nothing
quite like urinating in the open air. I look forward to
hearing about the White Lodge.
The Major, his mouth full, gives a "thumbs up."

Cooper moves behind a tree to urinate. An OWL SCREECHES.
ON THE TREE BRANCHES above him, two luminous EYES shine out of the darkness.
Cooper heads back to camp. There's another OWL SCREECH - much louder, more chilling.
And between him and campsite, a flash of WHITE LIGHT.

COOPER
M'am, that's very hard to say.
TRUMAN
So Betty you're saying this behavior is part of the way the
Major operates.
MRS. BRIGGS
Let me ask you this: did he leave suddenly?
COOPER
Yes. We were speaking philosophically. Then I left the
site to answer a call of nature. He was gone when I
returned.
MRS. BRIGGS
The fact that you were in the woods is very significant.
TRUMAN

Betty, I'm afraid there's not much we can do now except
keep an eye out. He can't be considered legally missing

COOPER
Be patient, Mrs. Briggs. Your husband has a renaissance
passion for exploration. That approach creates its own
schedules.
MRS. BRIGGS
That is how he sees himself. There's no manual for it;
there's also no manual for being married to it.

Garland left some brief notes on his nightstand. I'll call

TRUMAN

Hardy's left, whose job it is to record testimony, tentatively takes down this response.
COOPER (CONT'D)
I'm completely confident in the rightness of my actions.
Some of it went down outside bureau stipulations, yes, I
accept that and I'll pay the price. But I'm innocent of
any criminal wrong doing. If they wish to charge me I'll
defend myself in a court of law.
HARDY
(to the man on his left)
Close the book.
(he does so; Hardy to Cooper)
Dale, there's a right way and a wrong way to do this. And
the first thing we expect a bureau man to do is stand up
for himself. A man who can't, who doesn't even try, may
be packing feathers where his spine's supposed to be.
COOPER

HARDY

What 'game'?
COOPER
The sound wind makes through the pines. The sentience

Your suspension will continue in force. The next moves

leg press machine. Hyperventilating in preparation, he looks up at his buddies, who are
looking back at him with curiously broad adolescent grins.
His sudden premonition of dread is answered by the bluejeaned figure dropping down into the
neighboring machine seat; she sets the weight before allowing herself to peek over.
NADINE
Hi, Mike.

Mike turns his head in dismay. He is both supremely irritated by, and unequipped to deal
with, this bizarre new shadow in his life. The guys are choking back amusement.
MIKE
Hello.
NADINE
(on a roll)
How are you?
MIKE
Just great. Listen, is there something you want?
NADINE
Now, Mike ... aren't we being a little forward?
Nonplussed, Mike starts working the leg extensions. It's all Nadine can do to keep her eyes
off him. With the half-hearted dissemblance of a schoolgirl, she also starts doing leg presses;
but she is doing them with six hundred pounds of weight.
The guys have stopped kidding. The room is virtually silent but for the lifting and pounding
down of weight when the WRESTLING COACH robustly enters.
COACH
Thattaway, Nelson ... I keep telling you guys, it's leg
power that wins matches ....
He then pulls up to a stunned shuffle, seeing the magazine next to Mike's is hoisting double the
weight. Being a coach, he is quick to recover.
COACH (CONTINUED)
And what's your name, little lady?
NADINE
(belle of the weight room)
Nadine Butler.
COACH
Tell me, Nadine ...
(big grin)
... ever give any thought to going out for the wrestling
team?
ANGLE ON Mike: will there be no escape from this girl?

8.  ROADSIDE BAR - DAY
Establish. On a barren stretch of the Interstate. A shoebox along the highwayside, with a sunlit
neon shingle that reads, "The Broken Bones". Parked in the foreground is an old white Corvette
convertible with a weather-worn red interior.

9.  ROADSIDE BAR
Dark. Near empty. Clearly a place that lives on night receipts and stray afternoon beers. The
BARTENDER steals a glance over at his only customer, an intent, demure BLONDE in a
purple silk jacket, mid-twenties. A wistful sadness clings to her like perfume.
JAMES HURLEY enters, takes a seat two down and orders a beer. It arrives. The bartender
fades into the background. James takes a long first drink, aware he's being watched.
WOMAN
Hi.
He moves his head a quarter turn, sees her through one eye and looks back into his beer.
JAMES
H'lo.
She kills the rest of a tequila, ice. There's another waiting beside it:
WOMAN
Headed somewhere?
JAMES
I'm sorry?
WOMAN
Is is someplace you're going or running from?
JAMES
You got it all wrong. I'm alright.
WOMAN
Men are always alright. Right up until they pull the
trigger.
The bartender snorts his amusement. Her return look pushes him further into the background.
WOMAN (CONT'D)
Then the neighbors march solemnly out to the news
cameras to tell us, "He was such a nice, quiet guy."
JAMES
I'm only quiet on the outside.
WOMAN
I can almost hear what's inside from here.
He relapses into a characteristic silence; feeling she's been a little harsh on this stranger, her
manner softens.

That's a nice jacket.
WOMAN
(dismissingly)
I'm glad you think so. Can you ... do anything with cars?
JAMES
Sure. 'Having problems with that Corvette?
WOMAN
No. While he was away on business, I foolishly took my
husband's Dusenburg out on the road. Someone squeezed
me on the highway, I ran it into a ditch. It would be a
very good idea for me to have the car repaired before my
husband, comes home.
JAMES
I could take a look.
(sips for courage)
My name's James.
WOMAN
Evelyn. Evelyn Marsh.
(sips for pleasure)
I live just up the road.
In the silence, he hears her legs crossing under the bar.
JAMES
We in a hurry?
(she smiles, shakes her head)
Mind if I play the box first?

EVELYN
(slides him down a quarter)
I don't exactly punch a clock, myself.
James slowly steps over to the jukebox. Something about this offer feels like more than it says
it is. He puts on a slow, soulful song about a wasted, violet life.
As James stands in the jukebox light looking for his next selection, the CAMERA recedes,
leaving them to the music, the dark empty bar, the bartender cleaning glasses.

ANDY BRENNAN is practicing his gun draw, taking aim at a calendar. We hear NOISE
from an entryway. Andy turns, lowered gun still absent-mindedly in hand, to see RICHARD
TREMAYNE entering with 'little brother', NICKY, a wide-eyed vulnerable-looking little
boy. Both are staring at the gun, which Andy holsters then extends a greeting to rival suitor.
ANDY
Good day, Dick.
TREMAYNE
Hello, Andy. This is Little Nicky, my charge from
Happy Helping Hand. Nicky, this is Deputy Andy.
ANDY
How do you do, young fella.
NICKY
Hi.
TREMAYNE
Andrew, old boy, Nicky and I just stopped off at
Horne's for a new wardrobe, we're just on our way for a
malted and we were hoping Lucy could join us.
ANDY
Oh shoot, Dick, Lucy's up at the Great Northern today
helping with the Milford wedding.
TREYMAYNE
Oh God,. that 's right; Dougie's getting married again.
NICKY
Lucy's not here?
TREMAYNE
Yes, unfortunately we'll have to meet Lucy another time.
Nicky realizes his dread: another abandonment. He looks up anxiously.
NICKY
But you, you promised. Where is she?
TREMAYNE
I'm afraid Lucy's very busy right now and doesn't have
time for us.
More resonance. The child begins lightly, silently crying. This is too much for Andy.

A look of gratitude, mixed with a little suspicion from Treymayne.

10A.  TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Hawk and Truman enter to find Cooper, pouring coffee from a pitcher on Truman's desk.
COOPER
(pouring himself some coffee)
Harry. Nine years ago I joined the bureau because I felt
it was the strongest statement I could make about the man
I wanted to become and the world I wanted to live in.
And now, suddenly all that's brushed aside. I have
absolutely no responsiblities. Nothing to do. And it
feels ...
(laser-eyed delight)
... fantastic.
Cooper sips from his cup. Looks up at Truman with a disbelieving stare; then suddenly spits
coffee halfway across the room. Truman shakes his head in amusement.
TRUMAN
Temp. Lucy's helping out with the Milford wedding.
COOPER
(putting down the cup)
Sorry about that.
TRUMAN
That's alright. We still need to clean up Hawk's.
HAWK

10A. CONTINUED:
TRUMAN
Coop ... what will you do if you can't clear yourself?
COOPER
Harry, last night, Major Briggs planted a seed in my
mind. And it's been germinating. The idea that by
focusing on our fears or desires about something, we give
them tremendous power. Consider this, Harry: perhaps
by our best-intentioned resistance of evil, we somehow
unknowingly join hands with it. Perpetuate it.
(he has lost the sheriff)
And now, being suspended, I'm suddenly empowered to
let go of my preoccupation with wrongdoing. I feel like
I've been exiled back to the natural rhythms of life.
TRUMAN
Well, if you ever come to feel you need a home base,
there'll always be a job for you here in Twin Peaks.
COOPER
(with emphatic gratitude)
Harry, in a world of continuing disorder, you are a rock.
Oh, Mrs. Briggs called. The notes beside Major Briggs's
bed? A rather detailed grocery list and a small
endearment. Nothing more.
(his eyes light up)
Hawk, Harry have either of you ever heard of a place
called the White Lodge.
TRUMAN
Can't say that I have.
Hawk's initial reply is a look of concern.
HAWK
Where did you hear of it?
COOPER
It was the last thing Major Briggs mentioned before he
disappeared. You know of it?
HAWK
(a cautious look at Harry)
Cooper, you may be fearless in this world. But there are
other worlds.
COOPER
Tell me more.

HAWK
Local legend. The White Lodge is a place where the
spirits that rule man and nature here reside.
COOPER
That's a place I'd like to see.
HAWK
Many have tried. They say it exists only on the spiritual
plane.
TRUMAN
(sitting; here we go again)
Maybe I'd better pull up a chair.
HAWK
There is also a legend of a place called The Black Lodge:
the shadow self of the White Lodge, a place of dark
forces that pull on this world. A world of nightmares:
shamans reduced to crying children; angry spirits pouring
from the woods; graves opening like flowers.
COOPER
Dangerous.
HAWK
The legend says every spirit must pass through there on
the path to perfection. There you will meet your own
shadow self. My people call it the Dweller on the
Threshold. But it is said that if you confront the Black
Lodge with imperfect courage, it will utterly annihilate
your soul.
COOPER
Holy Smokes.
Just then: an intercom BUZZ. The temp's vaguely confused VOICE is heard:
TEMP'S VOICE
Agent Crewper? Agent Bryson here to see you.
COOPER

Dennis and I worked together in Oakland a couple years
back. Broke a smuggling ring. One of the finest minds in
the DEA, Harry. We're in good hands.

Long skirt. Light makeup.
COOPER

MAN IN DRESS
It's a long story, but I prefer Denise if you don't mind.
COOPER
Okay. This is Sheriff Truman. Deputy Hawk.
DENISE
Pleased. Denise Bryson, Drug Enforcement Agency.
Oblivious to the stares, Bryson sits and opens his briefcase. He is clearly business first.
DENISE (CONT'D)
Nice ride out here ... hard to believe you even have any
crime, Sheriff, I picture you chasing lost dogs, locking
up the town drunk ...
TRUMAN
It's a little more involved.
DENISE
Let's move right through this, Dale. The DEA's interest
stems from allegations made by an RCMP officer that
you stole drugs being used by him in a sting operation.
COOPER
Patently untrue: Denise, I believe I'm being set up.
DENISE
My recent experience has taught me never to judge too
quickly.

I think there may be some major chemistry developing ...

Mike approaches, Nadine hurries to him, girlishly leans into his path.
NADINE
Hi, Mike. Guess who's thinking about going out for the
wrestling team?
Donna looks over at Mike; this can't be true. Wrestling? Mike shrugs back in the affirmative.
NADINE (CONT'D)
I promise to take it easy on you in practice.
Mike, who's had enough, smiles acidly and moves on. Nadine watches hungrily.

That one loses Donna completely. Nadine scampers off.

12.  TRUMAN'S CABIN - AFTERNOON
JOSIE'S sitting up in bed, finishing her lunch. Truman sits at her bedside.
TRUMAN
All right. It's time you tell me where you've been and
what you've been through. I have to know the truth. I
can't go on doing this, being with you unless I know.
JOSIE
(stroking his face)
Harry ...
He takes her hand gently but firmly away from his face.
TRUMAN
The truth.
JOSIE
(pause, completely different tone)
I used to work for a man in Hong Kong. His name is
Thomas Eckhardt. He ... helped me. He took me off the
streets when I was sixteen. If you're from a poor family,
sometimes they ... sell the female children. I was lucky.
Truman struggles to keep his emotional resolve.
JOSIE (CONT'D)
He taught me about life and he taught me about business.
He was my father. My master. My lover. I never
questioned him or anything he did. Then a day came
when I learned too much. He had a man killed, a business
partner who had wronged him. Murdered. I saw it done.
TRUMAN
Did you go to the police?
(CONTINUED)
19.
12. CONTINUED:
JOSIE
He owns the police. When I met Andrew Packard I was
already afraid for my life. Andrew was also a business
partner. He was good and kind, and when he asked me to
marry him, I said yes, to come with him, and to get away
from Eckhardt.
TRUMAN
Who was this Mr. Lee? Your "cousin?"
JOSIE
Harry, I'm sorry. I was trying to keep you out of this.
The less you know the better -
TRUMAN
Who was he?
JOSIE
That man works for Eckhardt. And he said if I didn't go
back with him he would kill you.
TRUMAN
Why?
JOSIE
Because Eckhardt wants me. He's never stopped wanting
me. He think I'm his property. When Andrew was alive
he could protect me. I now believe Eckhardt is the man
responsible for Andrew's death.
(pauses, makes sure Truman's buying - he is)
Jonathan was driving me to the airport in Seattle. I
jumped out of the car. I'd rather die. I'd rather die than
go back to that monster ...
TRUMAN
Josie, stop. You're here with me.
JOSIE

Now he'll kill both of us.
Truman takes her in his arms. Quiet. Determined.

NORMA

Coming up. You won't be disappointed.
Norma turns to go. But familiar voices catch her attention. HANK and ERNIE enter,
singing a hunting song, spirited and sleepless from the expedition. Ernie looks far the more
worn; he as clearly had his clock cleaned by a thorough professional.
HANK
Hello, sunshine. Can we get some coffee?
Hank drifts toward the back, Ernie drops onto a counter seat, where Norma immediately
draws him some coffee. Ernie trombones into a handkefchief.
NORMA
How was the hunting expedition? Catch anything?
HANK

Hope not.
ERNIE
Catch anything? I came across a twelve-point buck
standing by a deepwater stream; looked me right in the

spilling his malted all over the extended left arm of Tremayne's natty, expensive sport coat.
TREMAYNE (CONTINUED)
Damn it! Damn it!
Nicky immediately begins to cry.
TREYMAYNE (CONTINUED)
(recovering)
That's okay. It's fine, Nicky. It's completely all right.
Tremayne reaches over the counter for some more serious cleanup materials. Andy leans away
from the chocolate spreading over the counter to lunge for some napkins. Little Nicky, with
slightly unexpected strength gives Andy's stool a mighty spin. Still facing away from them
as he cleans himself off, Andy lowers himself back onto the edge of his seat, hits the spinning
stool and flies directly to the floor. Norma and Tremayne look up from their mopwork.
CLOSE ON Nicky, his cherubic face still streaked with whipped cream, the slight upward
curve of his lips suggesting a tiny, unsettling smile.

Sometimes riding at night, I punch off my headlight, turn

There's a room above the garage. You can stay there while

17.  BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
START CLOSE on a projector screen surrounded by darkness. Flickering before us is silent
footage of Ben as a young boy, eagerly witnessing a groundbreaking ceremony. Images of
young Ben, Jerry, their bearded FATHER, dance across the screen. Horne Sr. shoves a spade
into the ground, unearths the ceremonial soil. All clap and celebrate. Smiles abound. In a
background a large sign proclaims: FUTURE SITE OF THE GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL.
It's a sentimental journey back to a simpler time and place.
PULL BACK from the screen into the darkened office, shades drawn, to Ben, seated in the
screen's reflected light watching his old glory days, sipping from a crystal glass, a nearly
empty bourbon bottle beside him, cigar smoke snaking up through the projector's beam. Then,
quietly at first, eyes fixed upon the screen ... Ben recites:
BEN
"Now is the winter of our discontent/Made glorious
summer by this sun of York; And in all the clouds that
lour'd upon our house/In the deep bosom of the ocean
buried./Now are our brows bound with victorious
wreaths; Our bruised arms hung up for monuments; Our
stern alarums changed to merry meetings; Our dreadful
marches to delightful measures."
A door opens. The silhouette in the doorway causes Ben to immediately douse the projector
and turn on his desk lamp. On the desk are a box of kleenex and several silver gravity toys.
Hank enters.
HANK
A stag party. And I wasn't even invited.
BEN
Hank, where have you been?
HANK
Ben, I have had an absolutely killer schedule.
BEN
Do you know what kind of hell I've been through the last
few days? You said you took care of Catherine in the
mill fire: she's alive. And as you might imagine, not
happy about it. Through extortion and trickery, she's now
managed to cheat me out of both Ghostwood and the
mill. And then there's the small matter of my being

could find the proper spatial relationship between all the
objects in a given space, it could create a resonance the
benefits of which to the individual dwelling in that space
could be extensive and far reaching. Help me move this
desk, would you?
Ben asks for a hand with the desk.
HANK
That's fascinating, Ben, really, listen, though, what we
have to do now is talk about One-Eyed Jacks.

Jacks, yes, One-Eyed Jacks, uh-huh.

HANK
Look at you. You're a mess. You screwed up, boss man.
You're out, Ben.
Hank exits. Ben glares at the door, then glances over at the burbon bottle. The blank
projector screen, the hum of the projector. He pours himself a drink, slouches back in the chair,
bathed in the light of the projector. A beat. Ben manages a bizarre smile and makes shadow
puppets on the wall. Little dancing rabbits for his own amusement

WINDOM EARLE'S VOICE
(think of Orson Welles)
Of course you couldn't help but take note of my
emphatically traditional opening. I must say your
responding move was nothing if not reflective of your
predeliction for the tidy and fastidious. See how my
response to you begins to lead us towards a classical
confrontation? But there's doubt in your mind: what are
my true intentions? How will you answer this time?
Hobgoblins, Dale; consistency, predictibility, giving rise
to patterns. We both know only too well how these
patterns leave you vulnerable to attack. You with your
wounds. I with mine. Let me paint you a picture. My
knights will skirmish. Lanes of power and influence will
open to my bishops and rooks. Pawns will naturally be
forfeit. I'm even prepared to sacrifice my queen because
I assure you, dear Dale, my goal will be attained at any
cost. The king must die.
The tape ends. Cooper grows pale.

19.  GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
Before the fireplace, the wedding ceremony of DOUGIE and LANA BUDDING is in
progress. Steady and easy, Dougie stands in a herringbone sports jacket and evergreen slacks.
Lana, her full body alight with flows of white and pink chiffon, looks something like an
exploding birthday cake.
The REVEREND performs the ceremony with a respectful air, seemingly dissembling his
own skepticism. The best man is PETE MARTELL; the maid of honor AUDREY HORNE.
Beyond them is a half-moon gallery seated in Great Northern dining chairs, with no separation
based on family (hers is not there). Some of those seated are Truman, Andy, Hawk, LOG
LADY, and a disgusted DWAYNE MILFORD, patting the hand of an older, blue-haired
WOMAN. Her stone-face suggests she is less than thrilled with the ongoing nuptials.
REVEREND
Do you, Douglas Milford, take this woman to be your
wife, to love and cherish, for as long as you both shall live.
DOUGIE
You bet, Reverend.
REVEREND
And do you, Lana Budding, take this man to be your
husband, to love honor and obey, so long as you both shall
live?
LANA
I do, your Honor.
REVEREND
If there be anyone here who knows not why this union
should be made, let him speak now or forever hold his -
DWAYNE
(leaping to his feet)
You're damned straight I object - that little
golddigger's after his money, his publishing empire, and
God knows what else - look at him, he's already got one
foot in the grave!
Truman and Hawk quickly hustle Dwayne off into the background.
TRUMAN
Okay, easy there, Mr. Mayor.

Pause. Dougie quietly comforts Lana.
DOUGIE
Don't give it another thought, doll.
REVEREND
So if there are no further objections ...

20.  COOPER'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
Cooper stands at his window, tape machine in hand.
COOPER
Diane, I am standing at the window of my room at the
Great Northern, looking down at the wedding of Dougie
Milford and his youthful bride. The ceremony appears
quite simple; the groom, commencing his fifth marriage,
has apparently honed the procedure down to the bone.
The reception will be starting shortly and a good deal of
alcohol will undoubtedly be consumed in order to
accomodate our culturally prevelant rally discomfort with
mystery and ritual.
(turns from window, sets down recorder, begins
to dress, speaks while peering in mirror)
Diane, I anticipate your question. I am not down among
the revelers because my mind is burdened with questions:
what's become of Major Briggs? What is the true
significance of the White and Black Lodge? Has the
Major, clearly a man of no small spiritual advancement,
perhaps been attempting to make contact with some
element of these places in his top-secret work? Briggs is a
man of clear eye and deep thought; he sees right through
the illusory texture of this world and fluently reads
beneath it. You might meet a handful like him in a
lifetime. But if what Hawk has related to me about the
Black Lodge is true, even a man of Briggs' considerable
fortitude would be tested to his ultimate limits.
(sits down on the bed)
In an even darker corner of my thoughts is my old partner,
Windom Earle, the man who, prior to his utter mental
and emotional collapse, burned with a brilliance I doubt
I will ever see the equal of. Add to that the things I've
witnessed here at Twin Peaks: the tremendous evil forces
that linger on the periphery of this genuine, spirited little
town. The darkness Laura Palmer submitted to. The

Diane, as a human being learns and matures, one's
experiences grow proportionately more rich and
mysterious. Perhaps the questions I now seek answers to
lie beyond the old perameters. Beyond my life at the
bureau.
The phone rings. He clicks off. Picks up.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Cooper ... yes, Denise ... I'll be right down.
He hangs up, stands to put his coat on, clicks on the recorder one more time.
COOPER (CONT'D)
Diane, when I've got a bit more time, remind me to tell
you about Agent Bryson ...

21.  GREAT NORTHERN BAR WEDDING RECEPTION - NIGHT
A mix of local townspeople and Dougie's friends. Cooper works his way through to find
Dennis/Denise waiting at the bar.
DENISE
Bad news first. I found cocaine residue in your car. My
guess is it's going to be a match to lot stolen from the
Mountie.
COOPER
Dennis, this can't look straight to you.
DENISE
Denise.
COOPER
Sorry.
DENISE
Sure it looks like a frame, Coop. But I'm going to need
more than your opinion to make that stick.
COOPER

Could I have another daquiri please?
COOPER
Dennis, if you don't mind my asking, what the hell
happened to you?
DENISE
Not at all. It's good to talk about it. It's simple,
really. Last year I was working undercover on a suburban
surveillance, some Bolivians were moving coke out of a
house across the street ... the seller had a few kinks, his rep
was he'd only sell to transvestites. So my partner and I
shacked up. I played the buyer and I found that wearing
women's clothes ... relaxed me. I continued wearing them
into the night. My partner thought it was my consummate
professionalism. It was a very confusing two weeks.
COOPER
To say the least.
DENISE
So one thing led to another and I'm currently into a
specialized kind of program called Gender Relocation
Inhibition Therapy, or G.R.I.T. Part of my treatment is
to dress the part for six months prior to any further
therapy; hormones, electrolysis -
COOPER
(more than he wanted to hear)
This is all a pretty astounding disclosure, Denise.
DENISE
Imagine how surprised I was. This isn't something you
exactly plan on.
A happy commotion from the reception across the room.

22. PETE MARTELL AND DWAYNE MILFORD
Seated a small table along the way, Pete and Dwayne sit over a couple drinks, watching
Dougie cuddle with his bride over the cutting of the wedding cake.
DWAYNE

PETE

Music turned out pretty good.
DWAYNE
Oughta' be a death march.
Across the room, Lana holds the ceremonial bouquet before a host of eager women. She flings
it up into a looping flight, from where it's suddenly snatched by an agile Denise. There's some
surly mumbling amongst the other girls about the bouquet-snagging by this ringer. Denise
sashays back to the bar, where Truman has now joined Cooper.
DENISE
Unfair advantage. How many of those girls were Varsity
wide receivers?
TRUMAN
Hope those two go up to the honeymoon suite soon. We've
had to separate Dwayne and Dougie twice. Happens
every wedding. My theory is Dwayne's jealous.
The ensemble music kicks up again. Denise looks a little wistful. Lana and Dougie swing by
in greeting.
DOUGIE
Sheriff, arrest this woman. She's too beautiful to be
living in this state.

They move off. Coming up on the periphery of this circle is Audrey Horne, approaching
Cooper, who pivots slightly on his barstool, folding them into a semi-private exchange.
AUDREY
Excuse me. Didn't you ... rescue me once?
COOPER
That's one version of the story.
AUDREY
One last dance?
Cooper accompanies her off to the dance floor. Denise sways slightly. It is now just he and
Truman. And Andy, hovering nearby.
DENISE
I love this music.

God ... I feel a little awkward. I .. would you ...
Truman's eyes widen with understanding. It's a waltz. Not that it really matters what it is.
TRUMAN
I'm not ... much of a dancer.
An awkward pause.

AUDREY
I heard you might be in trouble.
COOPER
Trouble in this instance, Audrey, may be a door to a new

AUDREY
I guess you could say that about everything you do.
COOPER
That's my hope, Audrey and my aspiration.
AUDREY
Well, if you ever decide to come down off the mountain
top and mingle with us regular folks, I'd like to hear
some of your stories.
COOPER
It's a deal. I hope they're interesting ones.
She smiles. He returns it. MOVE OFF them to Andy and Denise; Denise is an excellent
dancer. And, surprise ... so is Andy. HOLD ON them for a beat. Something absurd and sweet
in Harry's gentlemanly acceptance. Couples now swirl about CAMERA, in a celebratory
rhythm ...

I won't waste your time. Your brother, my husband,
Andrew Packard ...
(a respectful glance over at the photograph)
... was killed by a man named Thomas Eckhardt.
Catherine's face retains its emotionless appearance.
JOSIE (CONT'D)
Eight years ago, Andrew got the better of Eckhardt in a
business deal. Eckhardt never forgets a slight. He sets an
hour aside every day to think about how he will ruin his
enemies. In this case, I was his answer. He introduced
me to Andrew. I was to make Andrew fall in love with
me, marry him and eventually help Eckhardt kill him.
Josie pauses, awaiting Catherine's response. She looks back in quiet arrogance.
CATHERINE
Dear, your slip is showing.
JOSIE
Excuse me?
CATHERINE

Tell me something I don't already know.

JOSIE
Eckhardt is the most evil man I've ever known. His
design was to ruin the Packard family, not just Andrew.
I've escaped him for the moment, but he'll come back for
me. And for you. That is why I'm here.

you contradict a single thing I tell you, I'll find this

straight: our "monitors" are pointed at deep space, but
the messages we intercepted that Briggs showed you
were sent from right here in these woods. Where they
were being sent to is another question.
He points to the map again, near the disappearance site. A stunned moment as this sinks in.
COOPER
Colonel, does this have anything to do with a place
called the White Lodge?

That's classified.

Andy discovers an ornate, purple wooden BOX on a luggage stand.
ANDY
Sheriff? Look at this.
The three gather around it and slowly, silently take out it's contents: two red clown noses,
monk's robe and cowl, large rubber bands, lotions, an eggbeater, and, finally, a lifelike mask
that bears an eerie resemblance to Gary Crosby. They stand there in awe of this discovery
until their focus is broken by shouting at the door. Mayor DWAYNE MILFORD, Dougie's
brother, walks into the room swelling with emotion.
DWAYNE
What a falling off was here ... Dougie. Lord, I hate to
say I told you so.

well have blown his brains out with a rifle. He never

LANA
He's right. I'm cursed.
HAWK

No, it's true. It started in high school. Prom night.

9.  HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY
Wrestling coach, BUCK WINGATE, lectures his assembled squad who stare at NADINE
HURLEY and MIKE NELSON standing next to one another in wrestling gear on the mat.
WINGATE
Boys, there's a story about a great football coach whose
name escapes me at the time who was dead set against
having black players on his team until the day they
brought him the most fantastic black halfback anyone
had ever seen. When what's his name watched him run
fifty yards and no one laid a hand on him, he shouted,
"Look at that Indian go!"
(slaps an arm around Nadine)
That coach accepted that athlete's desire to compete.
Today that same story applies to this woman's ... young
girl's right to compete as well. In addition to which,
it's her moral and constitutional right.
(now puts his arm around Mike)
Nadine has asked to prove herself to us by wrestling the
very best: our very own District champion, Mike Nelson
(he turns Nadine and Mike toward each other)
Ready to wrestle at the sound of the whistle ...
Wingate blows his whistle. Nadine and Mike circle each other looking for the take down.
Hesitatingly, Mike makes a move for Nadine's legs, she takes him by the shoulders and lifts
him above her head. She carries on a conversation only she and Mike can hear.
NADINE
Hi, Mike.
MIKE
What are you doing?
Mike looks down at Nadine helplessly. She lowers him to the mat. Whispering to him.
NADINE
Isn't it fun we get to be so close in public?
MIKE

Littlehorse follows Cooper into the room. The place is a mess with the exception of a table

LITTLEHORSE

COOPER
There's been a meeting here. Within the last few hours.
He hunts around for something else. Sticks his hand into the drain in the sink.

Cooper lies on the floor under the table with his head flat against it. A bird's eye view. He
slides his head along the floor. Finds what he is looking for. He licks his finger, runs it along
the floor and brings it up covered with white powder. He shows it to Littlehorse.

Tremayne's car is pulled to the side of the road with a flat tire. Tremayne has managed to get
the car up on a jack. The lug nuts, the spare wheel, and the flat tire lie before him. He's trying
to read the jack's directions, leaning against the hood.
TREMAYNE
I don't understand this at all. I just had the car checked
at the Gas Farm and they assured me everything was in
perfect working order. This all seems so ... technical.
(his concentration is broken by a piercing blast
from the car's horn)
Please, Nicky, Uncle Dick is trying to read -
(drowned out by more blasts from the horn.
Tremayne snaps)
Get out of the car, Nicholas. Nicholas, get out of the
car! Right now, out of the car! Out of the CAR!
The horn stops. Pause. Nicky exits the car and moves sheepishly to Tremayne.
NICKY
Are you mad at me, Uncle Dick?
TREMAYNE
(back in control)
No, no, of course, not. Why should I be mad?
NICKY
I scared you, didn't I? You jumped around like a do- do
bird.
He laughs. Tremayne goes back to work. Nicky wanders away.
QUICK DISSOLVE:
ANOTHER ANGLE
Tremayne brings the tire up to put it on the axle, he leans into the wheel well. As he does this
the car slowly begins to rock off it's jack ... about to come down on Tremayne's neck and
shoulder. Tremayne realizes this just in time and pulls away. His glove is caught in the wheel
well. He watches as the fingers of the glove are torn off and crushed. A very close call. From
behind him, Nicky appears crying his eyes out.
NICKY
Uncle Dick, Uncle Dick.
He rushes into Tremayne's embrace.

James works below the Dusenberg on a sled. EVELYN MARSH moves into the room. James
sneaks a look as she walks towards the car; she wears an opened blouse and cut off jeans. She
carries a six pack of beer and limes. James slides the sled out.
EVELYN
Coffe break?
JAMES
Sounds great. Give me just a second.
James slides back under for a moment. Evelyn drifts to the window, stands in the sunlight.
EVELYN
It's so hot today. Feels like Indian summer. Can you
have Indian summer in the spring?
JAMES
I don't know why not.
She turns back, as James comes out from under the car.
EVELYN
I love the sun. Feels like it could just burn away all your
troubles. Wouldn't that be nice?

COOPER
Diane, I am holding in my hand a nationally distributed
newspaper. Plenty of color pictures. My opening move
responding to Earle's opening move was printed per my
instructions in the Personals column ... but I've already
received his response to this ... yesterday. He
anticipated my opening move perfectly. I wonder where
he is. I wonder what he's planning.
(getting up to pace about room)
In the meantime, I have spent my first full day without
badge and gun the best way I know how: occupying both
body and spirit. Real estate, Diane what the local agent
charitably describes as a Fixer-Upper. Nonetheless, it's
the sort of where a man might build a home, raise
a family, I which in spite of my past, I still hope to do
both someday. However, as is so often the case, even this
bucolic hideway is filled with secrets. Secrets that
may be connected to my troubles with the Bureau. Not
to mention the cocaine found in my automobile.
(beat, a little sad)
Agent Hardy's deliberations will soon be completed. If
I can't adequately defend myself there is the very real
possibility of imprisonment. Other innocent men have
served there, apparently with no great detriment to the
development of their character. If I must go, I hope I
can uphold the tradition established by Doestoyevsky,
Solzhinytsen and many other great Russian authors.
Cooper pauses, sad, uncertain. He pulls the Bookhouse Boy patch out of his pocket, just holds
it for a moment. As if to consider his future. Suddenly: a knock at the door. Cooper turns off
the recorder, steps carefully to answer it. Out of habit, he reaches toward his shoulder holster,

Moments later. Lucy returns to her post through the now empty lobby. She looks about,
reacts, picks up an incoming call.
LUCY
Sheriffs Station, how can I help you? One moment,
please.

Sheriff Truman? Sheriff

knocks)
Sheriff?
No reply. Lucy leans closer, she can hear LAUGHTER from inside. She opens the door.

29.  SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Lucy stands in the doorway.
LUCY
Sheriff?
Lana Budding sits on the Sheriffs desk surrounded by ardent suitors. Truman, Doc Hayward,
Andy, Hawk and Tremayne. Sweetly, in mid-tale:
LANA
... and so then I said, "But what do you think underpants
are for, anyway?"
The men react with laughter and affection. All eyes upon her. Tremayne leans closer.
TREMAYNE
Tell us another one. Please, Lana?
HAYWARD
C'mon, Lana. One more.
TRUMAN
Quiet, guys. Give her some room.
LANA
Okay. One time I had this cousin who was a clown in
this rodeo and there was all these really big horses ...
Andy leaps up to refill Lana's glass. Lucy reacts with rolling eyes, revulsion. But no one even
notices as she pivots, slams the door behind her. A beat. And the mounted deer head creaks,
tilts, and SMASHES down on a vacant chair. Only seconds after Andy left it. HOLD ON
Andy's near-miss for a beat.

ED HURLEY sits at the counter, drags a fork through a piece of cherry pie. He's quiet, sad.
NORMA'S VOICE

Are you going to eat that pie, or push it all over my
china?
Ed looks up, sees NORMA JENNINGS standing there.
ED
I'm not all that hungry.
NORMA
Want to talk about it?
ED
You don't want to hear my troubles.
NORMA
We used to talk about everything. We still can, Ed.
A long beat. Ed just looks at her. She's still the woman he loves.
ED
Remember when we were kids? Al the plans we made
It was like we were waiting for our lives to begin.
Planning all the stuff we'd do when they did. But
somehow, life starts before you know it. And suddenly
you're halfway through living it, and all those plans don't
mean a thing.

I'm living my life, Norma. I don't like it much.
Norma reaches down, takes his hand. A beat. Ed brings Norma's palm to his lips, gently
kisses it. As if to find refuge there.

Maybe we can make new plans.
Ed looks up at Norma, hopeful. Norma smiles. But CAMERA REVEALS someone

across from him.
ERNIE

Denise produces the photographs from Dead Dog Farm, tosses them onto the table. Shows
Ernie her i.d. and badge.
DENISE
Mr. Niles, I'm not going to put the squeeze on. You've
been to prison, I don't need to paint you any pictures.
ERNIE
Wha - what are you talking about?
DENISE
For starters you're guilty of a serious parole violation.
Enough to put you back inside. And unless you
cooperate, I'll do everything in my power to keep you

A beat. Ernie takes a deep breath, pulls himself together. Then:
ERNIE
They have five kilos of cocaine to sell. They need a
buyer. To save myself, I told them I could find one.
COOPER
Have you?
ERNIE

34.  GARAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT
James tosses and turns in his bed, then stops suddenly, listens. Voices shouting in the night.
James hurries to the window that faces the main house. The sounds continue, but more
ambiguous now. A fight? Some more innocent disturbance? There's no way for James to be
sure. Just then: footsteps approaching. James turns: Malcom steps into the room. He drinks
deeply from a tall glass, steps toward the window to peer back at the main house. Quietly drunk.
JAMES
Is she alright?
MALCOM
The first time he beat her, I swore revenge. Something
violent and noble. Evelyn begged me not to hurt him.
She made me promise. For both our sakes. That was
four years ago.

Bobby Briggs steps carefully through the dark living room. Then he stops, SEES someone
sitting in an armchair. Startled, Bobby lets out a whoop and leaps backward. The figure
reaches for a standing lamp, turns it on. Revealing Bobby's mother, BETTY BRIGGS.
BOBBY
Jeez, Mom. You almost gave me a heart attack.
BETTY
I'm sorry.
BOBBY
What are you doin' alone in the dark.
BETTY
Nothing. Just sitting here.
BOBBY
Well read a book or something, will you. It's creepy.

It's Dad, right?
Betty nods, bites her lip. A beat. And Bobby steps to her, kneels at his mother's side.
BOBBY
Hey. He's coming back. You know he will. This is just
some of that top secret jazz.
BETTY
I'm not so sure this time.
Betty begins to cry. Bobby pauses. He doesn't know what to do. Then, a little awkward:
BOBBY
Guess you really love him, huh?
BETTY

Completely.
Bobby sits down, leans against the chair. He reaches into his jacket for a cigarette. Lights it.

I was at the Double R last week. Dad and I, we had this

was there, and I was there too. Living a life of "deep
harmony and joy." Something like that. And there was
all this stuff about my future. Good stuff. Kind'a nuts.
But it was cool.
BETTY
Your father is an extraordinary man.
BOBBY
My father is a deeply weird individual.
(quietly, with affection)
He has a lot more goin' on under his hat than most
people. That's for sure.
Betty smiles. Bobby's not far wrong.
BETTY

When I sleep at night, he runs his fingers through my hair.
He doesn't think I notice. But I do.
Just then: a noise from the front door. Both react, and MAJOR BRIGGS walks into the living
room noticeably disheveled. There's a faint, almost imperceptible glow in his eyes. Bobby
and Betty Briggs react with stunned silence. Briggs finally speaks:
BRIGGS
(a little foggy)
How long have I been gone?
BETTY
Two days.
BRIGGS
Strange. It seemed much shorter.
Betty Briggs rushes into his arms. Bobby gets to his feet. He's not up to a hug. But Bobby can't
help but exhibit a little relief. Briggs speaks to him over his wife's shoulder.
BRIGGS (CONTINUED)

FADE IN:
1A.  WOODS - DAY
MAJOR BRIGGS sits in an armchair in the middle of a fog forest clearing. It's an odd
image. As if it occurred inside his mind. Briggs' moods shifts with great alacrity, alternating
between inchoate rambling and coherence, as if someone had popped his mental cork.
BRIGGS
I ... I remember stepping from the flames, a vague shape
in the dark ... then nothing. Until I found myself standing
by the cold remains of our campfire. Two days later.
VOICES enter the Major's dreamscape. Dr. Hayward and Agent Cooper.
HAYWARD'S VOICE
Major, there are some new therapeutic techniques that
might help us to break through your amnesia.
BRIGGS
My memories are immune to regression. I can feel
them, they are palpable. The smell and sensations...
everything is known to me. Yet somehow beyond my
reach.
COOPER'S VOICE
Do you remember anything else?
BRIGGS
Very little. Save for one disturbing image. A giant
owl. Pervasive.
COOPER'S VOICE
A giant owl. How big?
SUDDENLY: a flash of blinding LIGHT, the image of a screeching OWL flying fast
and low, and a second FLASH leading us to...

1.  SHERIFF'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Briggs seated in the same armchair inside the conference room. AGENT COOPER and
SHERIFF TRUMAN gather around him. DR. HAYWARD completes a physical exam, has
just snapped a poloroid of the Major's head - hence the second FLASH of light.
BRIGGS

Enough to cloud my mind and memory.

HAYWARD

findings)
Three triangular scars behind his right ear. In perfect
proportion.
TRUMAN
(still the skeptic)
Major Briggs, exactly what kind of work do you do?
BRIGGS
That information is, as I have repeated endlessly to
myself ... classified. Though the keeping of secrets
seems less meaningful to me now.
(his mind wanders)
Perhaps there are sources of information that transcend
the human need to conspire. Information of such weight
that it pertains not to the ...
(struggling, emotional)
My God, is this meant for the soul, my soul ...?
COOPER
(gentle prompting)
Maybe you should start at the beginning.
BRIGGS
(after a beat)
Are you familiar with Project Blue Book?
COOPER
The Air Force project dedicated to the investigation of
Unidentified Flying Objects.
BRIGGS
(pulling himself together)
Officially disbanded in 1969. But there are those of us
who continue in an unofficial capacity. Examining the
heavens as before. And, in the case of Twin Peaks, the
earth below.

We are searching for a place called the White Lodge -
Cooper reacts, remembers Hawk's stories. But before he can answer... a knock at the door,
followed by the entrance of two stern UNIFORMED MP'S.
MP #1

Briggs rises to join them. The MP's mean to escort him to the door. Truman protests.
TRUMAN
Now wait just one minute...
MP #1
Colonel Reilly's orders.
BRIGGS (mediating)
I'm afraid we will have to continue this discussion at a
later date. Goodbye.
With that, the MP's lead Briggs from the room. Hayward looks at the poloroid, now
developed. He hands it to Agent Cooper. Three scars behind the Majors right ear in perfect
proportion. Just then: a drop of WATER falls from above, splatters upon the image From a
fire sprinkler overhead. Just like the one that heralded Bob's flight to freedom.
2. HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY
ERNIE NILES stares at the telephone on Truman's desk as if, it was his worst enemy.
DENISE BRYSON stands nearby, gestures toward it.
DENISE
Go ahead, Ernie. It won't bite.
ERNIE
(rising, and lying, to the occasion)
A lot you know. We're dealing with a murderous thug
here. Not that I haven't had plenty of dealings with his
kind before. Jean Renault is a hard man, but I've known
men who'd make him quiver -
DENISE
Ernie.
ERNIE
All right, all right, all right.
Ernie picks up the receiver. Just then: Cooper and Truman step into the room. Startled, Ernie
returns the receiver to its cradle with a resounding SLAM.

Please don't make me do this. This is suicide. I know.
I'm begging you, please. I don't want to. I'm begging.
Denise deadpans, gestures toward the telephone. A long beat. Ernie sighs, dials. Someone
answers. He pales a bit, pauses, then, meekly:
ERNIE
May I please speak to Jean Renault?

3. A STATION CORRIDOR - DAY
Deputy ANDY BRENNEN enters a corridor, finds Tremayne waiting for him.
TREMAYNE
Andrew, where have you been?
ANDY
Cat in tree.
TREMAYNE
A peace officer's work is never done. Lucky for us my
efforts bore more palatable fruit.

I paid the Happy Helping Hand adoption agency a visit
where several blue-haired ladies were only too happy to
sup from my open palm. Unfortunately, all of Little
Nicky's records had been sealed and returned to the
Orphanage.
ANDY
We'll never know what really happened to Little Nicky's
parents.

Follow me.
Andy and Tremayne exit. Lucy peeks out of her cubicle, curious. All she SEES is Agent
Cooper as he approaches. Cooper wonders:
COOPER
Any luck, Lucy?
LUCY
I checked the personals columns in every national
newspaper on the list and I didn't find anything that
looked like a chess thing or any mention of the name
Windom Earle. Sorry.

appearance of NADINE HURLEY at the stool beside him.
NADINE
Good morning, Mike Nelson!
MIKE

Oh, Lord.
NADINE
Wanna share a soda? How about a nice big piece of
cherry pie. Two forks.
MIKE
Mrs. Hurley, Nadine, I want my own piece of cherry pie.
In fact, I want two pieces of cherry pie for myself
NADINE
Okay. Meat loaf!
MIKE
(anger rising)
Cherry pie and coffee. In fact, sixteen cups of coffee.
(at Nadine)
I don't want to talk with you. I don't want to walk with
you. I don't want to see you. I don't want to know you.
Is that clear enough to understand? Or will I need a
court order to get my point across?
A long beat. Nadine's worldview severely challenged. She bows her head for a beat,
chastised. Then looks up, the light of love not yet extinguished in her eyes.
NADINE
Mike Nelson you are the handsomest boy I've ever
known. And I would really like it if you and I could go
out on a date.
A beat of stunned silence. Suddenly - Nadine gives Mike a kiss. Deep, much deeper than he
has ever been kissed before. And more sexual than the kisses of a hundred high school girls.

HANK enters from the kitchen, carrying an order. He pauses to watch NORMA
JENNINGS grab car keys and purse from a shelf beneath the register.
HANK
Where're you headed?
NORMA
I've got a couple errands.
HANK

Little early for errands, isn't it? We've still got most of
the breakfast crowd.
NORMA

SHELLY

BOBBY
You're lookin' at Ben Horne's brand new boy. Do the
words "golden opportunity" mean anything to you? This
is my big break. And I've got better things to do than
give Leo Johnson a bubble bath.
SHELLY
And what about me? Don't I have anything better to do?

Not that I can think of.
He didn't mean it. Shelly SLAPS him hard across the face. Bobby stares at her for a beat.

James lowers the receiver from his lips. Evelyn steps closer, she smiles.
EVELYN
Long distance?
JAMES

EVELYN
Are you homesick, James?
JAMES

Evelyn runs her hand along the Jaguar's sleek lines. As she approaches, James can see a bruise
beneath her right eye. A wound the sunglasses cannot completely hide.
EVELYN
Tell me about Twin Peaks.
JAMES

There isn't much to say.
EVELYN
You could start with why you left. A woman, as I recall.
Two of them.
Evelyn's keeping it light. A gentle flirtation. James responds quietly, lets a secret out of his
heart.

crazy. Suddenly my life belonged to something else.
To Laura. And no matter what I did, or how much I
tried to help, and I tried, I really did...

Another girl died. And all I wanted to do was get on
my bike and ride as far away from Twin Peaks as it
would take me.
James pauses, deeply shaken. Evelyn steps to him, takes James into her arms. A long beat.
She whispers:
EVELYN
(genuine compassion)
I know the feeling, James. I know the feeling.
Their mouths come closer together, awkward, shy. They kiss. James gently removes her
sunglasses. He wants to see into her eyes. A long beat. James traces the bruise on her check
with his fingertips.
JAMES
Why do you let him hurt you?
Evelyn takes his hand, presses it against her lips. She will not answer. Instead, she kisses James
with great passion. Their embrace deepens. Suddenly: the SOUND of a car pulling up the drive.
Evelyn steps out of James' arms, looks to the main house. MALCOM steps out of a limousine,
pauses to shoot a warning glance in their direction. Then proceeds inside.
EVELYN
Jeffrey's leaving.
Evelyn turns back to James, whispers before leaving.
EVELYN
I need you. Will you help me?

15.  HURLEY HOUSE - DAY
BIG ED HURLEY steps nervously about the living room, checks a clock on the knickknack

Double R uniform. An awkward beat. Neither sure just what to say or do. Then:
ED
Norma, I've been thinking -
NORMA

Ed, I came here so I could -
ED

You first.
NORMA

Okay. When I go to bed, you're the last thing I think of.
When I wake up, you're the first thing on
my mind. I know the world's gone to pieces. And I
know it all seems designed to keep us apart. But there's
one thing bad luck never takes into account. We love
each other, Ed. And I think we have to stand up to that.
No matter what.

HAWK

You're sweating like a pig, Mr. Niles.

I suffer from nervous perspiration. Hyperhidrosis. It's a

Repeat your instructions. Step by step.
ERNIE

I take Denise up to Dead Dog Farm, introduce her to
Renault as a big-time buyer from Seattle. I lead
Renault through the buy. Complete the transaction. And

Just how long will it take you to storm the farmhouse? I

Hi. We're the Brunston's. I know we're a little early.
But we were just so damn eager to see him ...

Can we see him? Where is Donnie?
Speechless, Andy simply points at Tremayne. Tremayne faces the unexpected guests, replies:
TREMAYNE

Dead.
The husband pales, the wife gasps. Tremayne improvises further.
TREMAYNE
Dead tired, that is. I'm afraid Donnie isn't feeling up to

DONNA
I've been looking for James everywhere. He hasn't been

to his house but I can't find him.
ED
Donna. Listen to me. James is all right. He called.
DONNA (impassioned)
Tell me.
ED (taking out an envelope)
James asked me to send him some money care of a bar

Donna peers at the envelope for a beat. An address written there.
DONNA
Let me take it to him.
ED
What about your folks?
DONNA
I'll speak to them. They'll understand.
Ed's not so sure, but Donna doesn't hesitate. She gives Ed a kiss on the cheek, exits. Ed pauses,
turns back to the bedroom. Norma's standing in the doorway. Both listen to the sound of
Donna's car driving away.

living room ... and finds Hank Jennings standing before him.
HANK
(murderous and cold)
Oh, Ed. The things we do for love.
Hank SLAMS his fist into Ed's jaw. Ed topples over backward. Hank leaps upon him. He'll
beat him to death if he can. Just then: someone OPENS the front door. Norma returning?
No. It's Nadine, carrying a satchel of books. Thinking about Mike. Thinking about Ed.
Thinking about her parents in Europe.
NADINE
Eddie? I'm home!
Nadine SEES Hank and Big Ed. One looming over the other.
NADINE
Eddie?
Hank turns to Nadine, revealing Ed below him, face bloodied and battered. Nadine reacts in
a flash. She leaps forward, swings her book satchel like a scimitar, bashing Hank in the head.
Hank yowls in protest, tries to avoid. But Nadine is stronger and faster than his darkest
nightmare. And now she turns the full force of her anger upon him.
Nadine batters Hank through the living room, pile-driving into a coffee table, hurling
him through the knickknack shelf, and with one last great punch...sends him careening over the
sofa. A beat of stunned silence. Hank lies still. Nadine hurries to Big Ed's side.
NADINE

26.  BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
A victorious Ben Horne, still in military raiment, eyes the battleground before him. Bobby
Briggs looks on with a sinking feeling. His big break is turning to sand before his eyes.
BEN
Colonel Chamberlain and the 20th Maine were trapped
at the summit of Little Round Top. A third of his men
already fallen. His one chance, his only chance, was to
take the offensive; to move his left flank down the
hillside, like a swinging gate and take us by surprise.
BOBBY (maybe he can break thru the fog)
Uh, Mr. Horne..?
BEN
But we were waiting for him. The 15th Alabama
attacked before the left flank was able to muster.
Chamberlain's desperate manuever ended in failure
(an arm around Bobby)
Little Round Top was ours. From this vantage point, we
were able to roll back the Federal line, setting the stage
for Pickett's mighty charge. And victory.
BOBBY
Victory. Oh boy.
Bobby looks to the door, Audrey peeking inside. He shrugs. What can I do? Meanwhile, Ben
produces a sword from behind his desk, hands it to Bobby with great fanfare.
BEN
General Meade, you have suffered in ignoble defeat. I
accept your unconditional surrender.
Bobby doesn't know what the hell to do. Ben wants him to hand the sword back.
BEN
General Meade. I accept your unconditional surrender.
BOBBY

Ben is out to lunch. The good news is he's about to win
the Civil War.

I'll call Uncle Jerry. He'Il know what to do. And
Doctor Jacoby. Maybe he needs an injection. Bobby, I

BOBBY

Okay, baby. Whatever you say. Bobby's on the case.
That may work with Shelly. But not this girl. She deadpans:

So you've come to gloat. Come to celebrate my
demise. Go ahead, then. Laugh. You've defeated me.
Left me for dead. As I have defeated General Meade.
There's something wistful in Ben's expression. A kind of vulnerability Catherine's never seen
before. Catherine looks at Ben for a beat. Then, a little wistful herself.
CATHERINE
True. I did come here to gloat. You double-crossed me.
You tried to kill me. And I, for the very best of reasons,
intended to bury you so deeply that future generations

Before you came here, Twin Peaks was a simple place.
My brothers sold drugs to truck-drivers and teenagers.
One-Eyed Jack's welcomed curious tourists and
businessmen. Quiet people lived quiet lives. Then a
pretty girl dies. And you arrive. Everything changes.
My brother Bernard is shot and left to die in the woods.
A grieving father smothers my surviving brother with a
pillow. Arson, kidnapping. More death and
destruction. Suddenly the quiet people here are no
longer quiet. Their simple dreams have become a
nightmare.

to shoot a hole in Cooper's chest)
What's one more death, after all? Maybe yours will be
the last. Maybe you brought the nightmare with you.
Renault is toying with Cooper, spinning words into ideas. But there is something eerily

rather Denise Bryson, in full Double R regalia.
DENISE
Suppertime.
Several things happen simultaneously; Jean looks closer at the waitress, dimly recognizes the
face. Denise lets the tray drop down to her waist, revealing a gun upon it. In one smooth
motion she hurls the pistol toward Cooper, even as he leaps forward out of his chair. Jean turns
to fire at Cooper. Denise drops Preston King with a right cross to the jaw.
Cooper shoots Renault through the heart. Sheriff Truman and Deputy Hawk pour inside, guns
ready. Both spot Renault dead on the floor. Denise cuffing Preston King. They lower their
weapons. A beat, then:

37.  LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Shelly sleeps curled up on the living room sofa. Still waiting for Bobby to come home. A
record plays on a stereo turntable nearby. Something soft and sweet. Then, suddenly, the
house lights FLICKER, the record begins to slow. The sweet tune distorts eerily. Shelly
wakes with a start.
SHELLY
(sleepy)
Bobby?
The lights FLICKER with greater intensity, now blacking out for seconds at a time. Shelly
slips off the sofa, steps toward the kitchen. Now afraid.
SHELLY
(whispered, hoping)
Bobby, is that you? This isn't funny.
Shelly comes upon Leo's bed revealed in the flickering light. She gasps. The bed is empty.
SHELLY
(her fear increases)
Bobby?
Shelly pivots, looks toward Leo's wheelchair. The wheelchair is empty.
SHELLY
Bobby!!
Shelly whirls about, hysterical. That's when she SEES him. Leo Johnson standing across the
room, swathed in shadow and light. Shelly SCREAMS. And the lights cease their flickering,
the house is plunged into absolute darkness.

38.  SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
OPEN ON the station interior. Pitch black, no lights anywhere. A beat. And LUCY
MORAN leads Cooper, Truman, and Hawk inside. Truman holds a flashlight toward the
dark, pauses to listen to Lucy. Cooper continues ahead.
LUCY
The voice on the phone said there was a bomb planted in
the woods but it didn't say which woods and then all of a
sudden there was this big BANG and the lights went out
and I couldn't find a candle so I called the fire
department.

TRUMAN
Was there a fire?
LUCY
Two of them. First there was one at the power station.
But most of the volunteer fire department was playing
bingo so it took a while to get everybody together.
Then there was the bang I told you about. It sounded
like it was right upstairs so we all got out of here.
Well, it turned out to be the transformer on the pole
right above and behind the building but we had to wait
to go back inside because the transformer was shooting
sparks everywhere and we were afraid it would start the
station on fire, too. But it didn't.
TRUMAN
Do they know what started it, Lucy?
LUCY
"Suspicious in nature," that's what Chief Kipple said. He was suffering
from smoke inhalation at the time so he sounded a little hoarse -
Suddenly Cooper's voice is heard in the dark.
COOPER'S VOICE
Harry!
Truman looks up, notices that Cooper and Hawk have proceeded ahead.
TRUMAN
Yeah, Coop?
COOPER'S VOICE
(grave)
You'd better take a look at this.
TRUMAN
(to Lucy)
Stay here.
Truman steps toward Cooper's voice. CAMERA FOLLOWS Truman, the flashlight's beam,
as he enters the office.
TRUMAN
Cooper?
Truman stops still. The flashlight's beam tracks across the office floor, REVEALS Cooper and
Hawk standing by Harry's desk, eyes turned toward his chair. Truman shifts, aims the flashlight
to follow their gaze ...
... and reveals a horrifying tableau. A DEAD MAN seated in the chair, eyes frozen wide in an
agonizing stare, mouth taped shut as if to silence screams. Before him, arrayed atop the desk, a
chess board. The dead man's hand has been set upon a knight, as if to make his next move.

TRUMAN

COOPER

It's a game of chess, Harry. This is Windom Earle's next
move.
HOLD ON Cooper for a beat.

ACT ONE
FADE IN:
1.  SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Close on the fibers of a fabric tape. We slowly pull back revealing that it is the tape covering
the mouth of the DEAD MAN. A surgical gloved hand reaches into the frame and slowly
pulls the tape off the mouth, inside the mouth attached to the tape is a black chess piece - a
pawn. We pull back to DOC HAYWARD, AGENT COOPER.
HAYWARD
Good Lord.
Cooper reaches in, removes the chess piece and examines it: it's a match to the pieces on the
chess board set up on the table. HARRY enters the room.
TRUMAN
No one saw a thing. The blackout and fire drew
everyone out of the building.
COOPER
Andy, we'll need this dusted for prints ...
Cooper drops the chess piece in a bag and hands it to ANDY standing inside the door with his
eyes closed so he won't see the body and cry. He reaches out for the bag, misses it. Truman
puts it in Andy's hand. Andy turns to leave and walks into to the wall with a thud. Andy peeks,
adjusts his trajectory and makes it.
TRUMAN
How long has he been dead, Doc?
HAYWARD
Hard to tell; we'll need an autopsy.
COOPER
Doc, open the victim's shirt. I believe you will find an
incision, a stab wound one inch beneath the sternum,
penetrating upwards, severing the aorta.
Hayward and Truman exchange a look then Doc opens the shirt. Cooper was right.
TRUMAN
You've seen this before.
COOPER
(nods, examines the floor)
No blood stains.

Cooper picks a pine needle up off the floor. Then walks to the middle windowsill, examines
with magnifier. HAWK comes in the door.
COOPER
Hawk, footprints?
HAWK
Two sets, same boots; one coming, one leaving. Heavier
impressions on the way down.
COOPER
Carrying the body.
TRUMAN
We should get molds made of those before it rains.
COOPER
He'll have been wearing the wrong size shoe, untraceable
and already destroyed.
HAWK
I followed them to the granite stream up the ridge, lost
them on the rocks.
COOPER
He knows how to mask a trail ... any cars stolen in town
recently?
TRUMAN
There was one a couple of days ago, from the Cash and
Carry on Sparkwood. No witnesses. Cooper, you're
sure Windom Earle's behind this?
Cooper nods, steps to the window, looks into the darkness.
COOPER
A short time ago, a vagrant ... our victim was befriended
and offered a lift. He was given some cheap wine and a
cigarette. The victim was then driven to a location up
behind the ridge, you'll find the car still up there. He
was stabbed, once, managed to run at least fifty yards,
cutting his hands and face on brush before collapsing.
Earle engineered the explosion that caused the power
failure, created the diversionary fire that drew everyone
outside the station, then brought the body in through this
window.
(turns, Faces them)
Windom Earle has been in this room. I can still feel his
presence. There aren't going to be any fingerprints in

Everything he does has its own rationale, precision and
intelligence. Windom Earle is a genius. And he's taken
his first pawn. In a very sick game.

Establish.
3.  GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - NIGHT
AUDREY and BOBBY sit at a small round table. The power is out. Candlelight illuminates
the scene. They have drinks between them. Plus a bucket of ice. Audrey drops a few cubes
into Bobby's glass and a few into hers.
AUDREY
Listen carefully, Bobby Briggs, here's what we're gonna
do. If I have learned anything from my father before he
flipped his wig it's that a business relationship is a
sacred pact, equaled only by the closest of personal
relationships ... where nothing is held back.
BOBBY
Right.
AUDREY
Do you want to get rich, Bobby?
BOBBY
Immediately.
AUDREY
Maybe I can help. This is the last of the ice cubes till the
power comes back on.
She reaches over and picks an ice cube out of Bobby's drink.
AUDREY
Now, pretend this is my father.
She closes her hand around it.
BOBBY
An ice cube?

AUDREY
Right. And our job now is to help my father find his
way back from Limbo-Land so he doesn't melt away and
leave me with a handful of nothing.
She reopens her hand, the cube is melted.
AUDREY
We wouldn't want that to happen, would we?
BOBBY
No.
AUDREY
From now on Bobby I'm the one you suck up to.
She licks up the melted water.
BOBBY
(a moment of conscience)
What about Shelly?
AUDREY
What about Shelly?
Bobby's eyes grow stalks. He finishes his drink.

5.  LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
POV, moving frantically through the darkened kitchen into the living room and to the door.
We pull back, SHELLY desperately tries to open the door but it's been locked from the out
side.
SHELLY

No!
She looks back into the kitchen, it's pitch black, she can't see a thing.

SHELLY
(pleading)
Oh, God ... please no.
The sound of a creaking wheel on the wheelchair is heard.
SHELLY
Leo?
Out of the darkness comes Leo's wheelchair directly toward her, it knocks over a lamp, comes
closer and closer. She jumps out of the way as it crashes into the door. Shelly starts for a
window, something flies through the air and lands at her feet. She freezes; a bar of soap in a
sock lays on the floor. A guttural laugh rises out of the darkness.
SHELLY
Don't do this, Leo.
From the darkness comes.
LEO
(slurred, and bursting with pride that he's e's back)
Le...O. Le...O.
The refrigerator door swings open. The light from inside illuminates a grinning crazedlooking LEO.
LEO
F-u-n-s o-v-e-r.
Leo laughs again. The refrigerator slowly closes. From the darkness comes the sound of a foot
dragging across the floor. Shelly makes a break for it, out of the darkness Leo's hand grabs
Shelly by the neck, pulls her close to him.
LEO
Le-o go-od.
He smiles, then throws her across the table, sending her and everything on the table crashing
into the corner.
LEO
Fu-n.
Leo shuffles toward Shelly, his left leg and arm not quite up to snuff. He stops, reaches up and
turns on the radio.
LEO
Le-o like mu-sic.

Shelly picks up a toaster and hurls it at him, bouncing it off his chest. Leo looks at the
toaster, then down at his chest.
LEO
Ow.
Shelly tries to run again, no luck, Leo has her, grabs her by the throat. He starts to spin her
around, his grip tightening on her throat as he does. Shelly tries to pull away, but even with
only one good arm Leo it too much, desperately close to passing out she strikes, gouging at his
eyes. Leo erupts in a rage, throws her into the living room where she crashes against the wall.
Leo then flips the kitchen table over and lets out an animal like howl.

6.  LEO'S BACK DOOR - NIGHT
Bobby steps up to the door, still buzzed from the evening with Audrey, takes in a deep breath
of the fresh night air, and hears Leo's howl.

7.  LEO'S
A bruised and battered Shelly cowers in the corner as Leo slowly approaches, a silent monster.

8.  LEO'S - NIGHT
Bobby tries the door but it won't open, then bangs on it.
BOBBY
Shelly? Shelly?
Bobby walks over to the window and looks in, rubs on the glass to get a clearer view. Shelly
pulls herself up to the glass, bruised and crying.
BOBBY
(immediate concern)
Shelly?
We hear the howl again, then Leo's fist comes crashing through the window. Bobby tumbles
away from the window in terror.
BOBBY

Leo?
From inside we hear Shelly scream, as Leo grabs her.

Bobby races to the door and tries to break it in, no luck.

9.  LEO'S - NIGHT
Leo has Shelly by the hair and is dragging her toward the living room. Off screen we can hear
the frantic pounding and shouts of Bobby. They reach the kitchen and Leo drops her onto the
floor. Stands over her for a long moment.
LEO
Good-bye wi-fe.
He raises up his big boot above her face, a tear falls from his eye, he's going to crush her.
Shelly screams. Bobby bursts through the back door and is on Leo before he can react. They
tumble to the floor, for a moment Bobby has an advantage.
BOBBY
You bastard!
Leo suddenly reaches up with tremendous strength, grabs a surprised Bobby by the neck and
flips him on to the floor, then is on top of him. Leo smiles.
LEO
Hell-o Bob-by.
Leo begins to laugh, then tightens his grip. Bobby gags, the throat is beginning to go. Bobby
manages to reach into a pocket and pull out his lighter, flicks it on. Leo stares at the flame,
transfixed. Bobby moves the lighter close to Leo's face. Leo smiles, transfixed. Bobby then
adjusts the flame and it shoots up into Leo's face, he erupts in a scream and covers his face with
his hands.
LEO
(screaming)
Ahhhh!
He stands, bounces off the walls knocking things down, then runs out into the darkness. Bobby
crawls over to Shelly, takes her in his arms, a tear falls from her eyes.
SHELLY
Bobby.
BOBBY
It's okay now, he's gone.

A flashbulb whites out the scene. When it clears, we are on a white sheet being draped over the
dead man laying on a stretcher. We pull back to Cooper looking tired from a long night of
forensic work which is winding up.
TRUMAN
No prints, no fibers. You were right. If it's Earle, he
didn't miss a beat.
(hands Cooper a cup of coffee)
Did you hear from Denise, uh, Agent Bryson?
COOPER
(nods assent)
The DEA and the Bureau have cleared me of all criminal
charges. But the suspension stands. I'm waiting to hear
from Gordon
TRUMAN
In the meantime you're still my deputy. This case is
your's if you want it.
Cooper looks at the body as it's carried out.
COOPER
I want it, Harry.
Hawk enters.
HAWK
Found that stolen car on a logging road just as you said
... no prints. And just so you know, Hank Jennings
missed the buy at Dead Dog because he was in the
hospital. Claims he was hit by a bus. I cuffed him to
the bed and booked him for parole violation. One more
thing: Shelly Johnson just called. She says Leo Johnson
came to last night, attacked her and ran off into the
woods.
Harry and Cooper react. Another flashbulb goes off.

11.  SHERIFF'S STATION, RECEPTION AREA - MORNING
Close on Andy trying desperately to pull off the surgical gloves he is wearing. He yanks, he
pulls, one last try and it shoots off across the room, sticking to the sliding window of

LUCY
A what?
The stretcher with the body is slowly wheeled out by TWO ATTENDANTS. One of the
wheels squeaks incredibly loudly. Both Andy and Lucy's eyes are glued to the body as it
slowly passes and exits.
ANDY
(looks around to make sure no one is listening)
We think he murdered his parents.
LUCY
He's nine years old.
ANDY
I know. We think he was six at the time of the crime -
LUCY
(slow boil)
I met little Nicky. I talked to little Nicky. If you two
think, for one second that I'll believe a little defenseless
orphan is a murderer ... the both of you aren't fit to be
fathers to a chimp!
Lucy reaches out, grabs one of the fingers on the glove Andy has on, stretches it out several feet
and lets go... wap!
LUCY
I'm going to get to the bottom of this, right now.
She storms out.

JAMES
See how you feel when you drive it.
JEFFREY
I'm sure it will be fine. Sounds like it's lucky we found

James can't place this pleasant man with the one who beats his wife. He feels like hell.
JAMES
Lucky for me too.
JEFFREY
I hear you're on the road.
JAMES
Yeah. Will be again soon, I guess.
JEFFREY
No itinerary, no deadlines ... I'm envious. Wish I was
going with you.
Evelyn locks her eyes on James who can feel the heat. Jeffrey opens the door to the car.
JEFFREY
Maybe after I take her out for a spin we'll talk shop.
Sounds like we have a mutual love.

Excuse me.
James leaves, heads for his room.
JEFFREY

He looks at Evelyn.
EVELYN
He's done a fine job on the car.
Jeffrey slides into the car and ignites the engine. Races the motor.

Let's see what it will do on the open road.
Evelyn kisses him through the car window.
EVELYN

Close on the flames in the fireplace. We pull back. BEN HORNE, dressed as General Lee,
puffs on a cigar as he sights a small cannon. On the floor of the office are toy soldiers in
marching columns and an elaborate train set. DOCTOR JACOBY sits across the battle field,
pencil and note pad in hand. The office doors swing open, Audrey enters with JERRY.

Jeb, a great day is upon us. By dawn our troops will be
on the outskirts of Washington. By mid-day it will fall,
and we will once again walk on my cherished fields in
Arlington.
(he looks at Jerry very solemnly)
Only God can stop us now. And it is my firm belief,
Jeb, that the almighty is a Southerner.
Ben moves back to his soldiers. Jerry looks at Audrey, then back at his brother, tries to smile.
JERRY
Hallelujah ...
Jerry glances over to Jacoby, motions him over to join Audrey and himself
JERRY
You think it's a good idea for Ben to be carrying a
sword?
JACOBY
Your brother is suffering from delusions brought about
by emotional collapse. He thinks he's on a forced march
to Washington. He's crossing the Maryland border as we
speak.
AUDREY
He's nuts.
JERRY

Why don't you let your uncle Jer decide that for himself.

Actually what he is doing is quite healthy. By reversing the South's
defeat in the civil war he will in turn reverse his own setbacks. What he
needs now is both your understanding, a confederate victory, and a good
price for his cotton. Metaphorically speaking.
Jacoby smiles. Jerry looks over at Ben.
BEN
Men of the South, from this day to the ending of the earth we who fight
shall be remembered. For our bravery. For the battle scars we bear.
We few. We happy few. We band of brothers. Onwards... to
Washington.

16.  TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
Close on the chess board set found with the body. We slowly circle it, coming to Cooper,
intently staring at it. Coffee cup in hand. Harry joins him.
TRUMAN
How does chess figure into all this?
Cooper studies the board for a moment, then looks at Harry.
COOPER
Because we played a game every day for three years. Windom felt all
of life could be found in the patterns and conflicts created on the board.
And because I never beat him, and we both know it. Now I have to
make my next move. I'll publish it in the Twin Peaks Chronicle
tomorrow. That should do it. He's close.
TRUMAN
Coop, I think I need some more information here.
COOPER
Harry, I've brought some baggage to town with me I haven't told
you about.
TRUMAN
(not demanding)
Well, as your superior -
Cooper turns to Harry. The coffee cup shakes in his hand. Both notice. For the first time
Truman sees fear in Cooper's eyes.
COOPER
Windom Earle was my first partner. Everything I know about the law
and the bureau I owe to him. Four years ago we drew the assignment of
protecting a material witness in a federal crime. She was a very gentle,
very beautiful woman. Her name was Caroline. She and I ... fell in love.

When I awoke, Caroline was in my arms. She was dead.
She had also been stabbed.
TRUMAN
(putting it together)
The wounds on the vagrant?
COOPER
Identical. The killer was never caught. My wounds
healed. Windom Earle ... went mad. Institutionalized,
until his recent escape.
TRUMAN
So why is he after you now?
COOPER
(a beat)
Harry, Caroline was Windom Earle's wife.
Harry takes a seat.
TRUMAN
So he blames you for her death.
COOPER
No. It's worse than that - much worse. I think he killed
her. And I think he also committed the murder that she
originally witnessed. He used to beat her, Harry, that's
what I found out when I ...
(can't continue for a moment)
Windom's mind is ... like a diamond. It's cold and
hard and brilliant and at some point he stopped caring
about right and wrong. I also believe Windom feigned
the insanity that sent him away. You don't know what
he's capable of. You don't know.

She holds up an envelope. The Bartender looks her over, then glances at Evelyn and nods.
Donna takes out a cigarette. She strikes a match, we follow it up to the cigarette.

Where's Nadine, Ed?
BIG ED
She's got a wrestling match up at Knife River. Doc,
Nadine's what I wanted to talk to you about. You're a

BIG ED
It's downright dangerous. She's liable to kill a young
kid. I don't know what to do.
DOC
Be patient. And tell her to be home by nine o'clock on
school nights.
(Ed smiles, Doc rises)
Ed, Donna took the van this morning, said something
about going to look for James. Is there anything I need
to be worried about?
BIG ED
He's out west a couple of hours, just trying to clear his head,
I think. Donna's taking him some money.
DOC
It's not easy being a parent is it?
BIG ED
It sure ain't.
Doc leaves, Norma walks over with a piece of pie. Slides in across from Ed.
NORMA
Hank's in the hospital. He says a tree fell on him.
(she reaches out and touches a bruise on his face)
Doesn't have anything to do with this, does it?
BIG ED
The tree was a redwood named Nadine.
(Norma doesn't quite get it)
Honey, after you left yesterday, Hank jumped me, right
in my own living room. The truth is, if Nadine hadn't
walked in when she did, it'd be me in the hospital or
someplace worse.

He reaches out, takes her hand.
BIG ED
We could start by getting a cabin, a bottle of sparkling
wine and some venison steaks.

BRIGGS
As men who have dedicated their lives to service, I know
you are able to understand how sacred I hold a pledge of
allegiance. And the cost one must pay when breaking a
pledge.
COOPER
It can be very great.
BRIGGS
The Air Force, I thought was not unlike other societies
of men, dedicated to the fight for good.
Harry and Cooper look at each other wondering. Briggs gets up from his chair.
BRIGGS
Gentlemen, frankly I'm worried. When my superiors
questioned me about my disappearance they exhibited a
degree of suspicion and intolerance bordering on the
paranoic. I must now admit that their motivation in the
search for the White Lodge is not ideologically pure.
(turns to them)
I believe that during my disappearance I was taken to
the White Lodge. I remember virtually nothing, but I
have the clear intuitive sense that there is much trouble
ahead.
COOPER
What kind of trouble?
BRIGGS
I am not aware of the form it will take.

He leaves, Truman and Cooper follow.

25.  CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Truman and Cooper enter, join Hawk and Andy. At the other end of the room stand Jacoby
and LANA.
JACOBY
Good, I wanted everyone to hear this. I have just spent
most of the last twenty four hours with this charming
young lady. And as you can see, I have no bruises, no
broken bones. Any claims by her deceased husband's
brother that she is cursed and somehow responsible for a
death is nonsense. What she does possess is a heightened
sexual drive and a working knowledge of technique,
anatomy, and touch, few men have ever had the pleasure
of experiencing, or the skill to match.
Lana blushes, smiles. Looks them all over. Pause.
TRUMAN

Lana kisses him again.

HAYWARD
When Lucy told me about your "theory" I called the
orphanage and cut through the red tape. I immediately
got to the bottom of things because I was there when it
all begin. Little Nicky is no more a murderer than
Lucy or I.
TREMAYNE

HAYWARD
Shut up and listen, the both of you.
Lucy smacks a bug with a flyswatter like it's a baseball.
HAYWARD
Little Nicky entered this world through the back door
where hope and promise never saw the light. His mother
was a poor immigrant chambermaid at the Great
Northern. Nicky was conceived during an assault by a
man in a back alley who fled across the border. She
never reported it to the police, but when she started to
show she reported it to me. But Nicky's mother had a
dream for a better life, for herself and her child. It was
the dream that brought her to this country. She decided
to carry that child. The poor wretch never saw the boy.
She died just as Nicky took his first breath. I delivered
that woman's baby. We buried her in Potter's Field and
sent the infant to the orphanage. For several years he was
shuttled from one state home to another. Then one day,
hope finally shined on little Nicky. A young childless
couple brought him into their lives. They were loving,
caring parents. It all collapsed in one terrible moment
on an icy highway. There was a crash. Six year old
Nicky managed to pull both his parents from the
burning wreck, but it was too late, and Nicky was alone
once again, as he is today.

EARLE sits next to him playing an antique wooden flute. Five stainless steel square suitcases
rest near him. The chess board is set up on the table. A small school desk sits by the door.
On one wall is a Earle's high tech command module - computer, modem, monitoring

Ah, you are awake, then.

EARLE
Well, Leo, I have cleansed your wounds. You're on the
mend. I've removed the proverbial thorn from your paw.
(tasting this)
Leo. Leo the Lion.
(plays a trill on the flute)
I want you to help me. And obey me. Will you do
that?
Leo hesitates. Earle shows the flute to Leo.
EARLE
In thirteenth century Japan the Samurai were stripped of
their weaponry. But they discovered that the aged and
treated bamboo of their Shaku hachi flute made an
excellent cudgel.
(smacks Leo again, then walks back to the table)
This flute is truly an instrument of pleasure, don't you
think?
Leo tries to make a run for it, but merely allows Earle to have more fun with his flute. It ends
with Earle standing over Leo near the doorway. He takes a dog collar out of his coat.
EARLE
I wanted to save this necklace for an "occasion," but now
you've ruined it.
He wraps the collar around Leo's neck. Attached is a round object that looks like a beer can.
EARLE
Now, come over here. I've made you some gruel.
As Earle returns to the table, Leo scrambles for the door. He stops short. Struggling with an
electrical shock coming from the collar. He falls backwards. Stunned. Earle sits at his table.

Come here, Leo. Come on.
Leo struggles towards the table as Earle plays his flute.

Why?
EVELYN
For the money. Out of fear. Because I wanted to.
Her words chill him. James' anger subsides. He expected excuses, regret. Anything but this.
EVELYN
That's not exactly what you want to hear, is it, James?
The truth hurts. I know.
James stares into her eyes. Evelyn moves closer. The truth hurts her too:
EVELYN
You're good and you're honest. I'm not. But that doesn't
mean there weren't moments when I truly wanted you
here. Not for the money or for Malcom. But for me.
For the good and honest way you taste.
A long beat. And despite everything she's told him, or perhaps, in some odd way, because of
it...James steps toward Evelyn's arms.
JAMES
I wanted you too.

They exchange a gentle kiss. A beat. Footsteps behind them, a sudden leap ... AND
MALCOLM APPEARS, STRIKES JAMES ON THE HEAD. James slips to the floor, lies
still. Evelyn looks at his inert form with shock, then to Malcolm.
Malcolm speaks quietly, words for Evelyn to commit to memory. Her story, her alibi, a tale
to be told to the police.
MALCOLM
(dead calm)
James broke into the house. He was angry, he was crazy.
He killed Jeffrey and now he came back to kill you. A
poor, helpless widow. But you were ready for him,
Evelyn. You got your gun ... and you shot James until he
was dead.
HOLD ON Evelyn for a beat. Malcolm before her. James helpless on the floor.

Establish.

26.  WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - NIGHT
A fire burns in the hearth casting warm light about the cabin. Windom Earle peers into a
mirror, carefully affixes a false mustache to his face, other concealing facial hair. He speaks
aloud as he prepares his disguise:
EARLE
Work slowly and with care. Everything must be written
in a steady, uncompromising hand.
Leo sits at a small wooden school desk, concentrates on a piece of writing paper before him.
He painstakingly copies from an open book of poetry, produces a version in his own hand. The
shock-collar still hangs about his neck. Earle steps behind him, peers over Leo's shoulder. He
uses his flute as a yard stick or marker.
EARLE
No, no, no. Terrible.
(pointing to offending section)
Erase.
Earle produces the shock collar control, presses a button. A low-grade SHOCK shivers
through Leo's body. Leo reacts with a shudder. Then erases in haste, looks up at Earle with
plaintive expression.
EARLE
Now. Try again. Concentrate.
Leo looks back to the paper. As if it was responsible for the shocks that course through him.
He puts pen to paper. But he errs again.
EARLE
(with manic disgust)
Oh, Leo. For heaven's sake.
Another stinging shock. Leo turns, as if to flee. But Earle is upon him. He grabs Leo's hand in
an iron grip.
EARLE
Let me show you.
Earle guides Leo's hand to the paper. And carefully leads him through the difficult section.
There is something odd and tender about Earle's actions. As teacher to pupil. Father to son.

EARLE
See? Like this. There you go. Much better. Now you
finish.
A beat. Leo proceeds, afraid, but more determined somehow. Earle watches with satisfaction
as Leo completes the unseen document. He gives Leo a friendly pat on the head.
EARLE
I am proud of you, Leo.
Leo looks up it Earle, eager to curry his favor, whispers.
LEO
Windom ... Earle...
EARLE
(pleased)
Yes. Windom.
Earle picks up Leo's work. THREE child-like VALENTINES. In the center of each heart is
a picture: Shelly, Donna, and Aubrey. They are surveillance photos. Leo has written their
names on each valentine.
EARLE
Pretty words for pretty girls. Which one will be my
Queen?
LEO
(fairly mindless repetition)
Queen ...
Earle carefully tears the page into vertical thirds . Leo reacts with a protesting groan.
LEO
No...
Earle looks at him sharply. Leo cowers at his school-desk. Earle produces three identical
envelopes, one for each torn third.

A surreal tableau follows. Grant's surrender as enacted by Ben Horne (as the victorious General
Lee), Dr. Jacoby (as the vanquished General Grant), Jerry Horne (as Wilmer McLean), Aubrey
(as daughter McLean) and Bobby (as the miserable Bugle Boy).
Ben pauses, midroom, surveys the small table at its center, the players grouped about him.
Aubrey steps forward with a smile.
AUDREY
(playing it up, and playing it well)
Welcome to our humble home, General Lee.
BEN
Thank you. You are ...?
AUDREY
Scarlett McLean. This is my father.
Aubrey gestures toward Jerry in his farmer's suit. But Jerry misses his cue, stands frozen with
stage fright. So Aubrey repeats:
AUDREY
(a little louder)
This is my father.
Jerry reacts, hurries forward, still clutching Ben's sword.
JERRY
(the world's worst southern accent)
Wilmer McLean at your service. I'm indeed honored to
make your extremely suitable acquaintance.
(offers the stagiest of bows)
BEN
Why are you armed with my sword?
JERRY
(stumped, remaining in bowed posture)
I ... like your sword. Sire.
Ben frowns, surrounded by idiots no matter which universe he inhabits. Aubrey ushers Jerry to
the side.

BEN

Where is General Grant?
JERRY

General Grant's a-comin', sire. I know'd it.
An awkward beat. Jacoby remains in hiding. Someone's missed their cue. Jerry looks at
Aubrey. Aubrey frowns, shoots a look at Bobby. Bobby plays a hasty toot on the bugle. The
cue Jacoby's been waiting for. A beat. And he steps forward, with as much diginity as
stepping from behind a curtain allows, into the room. Ben reacts to the odd entrance, ignores
it. And extends a hand.
BEN
General Grant.
JACOBY
General Lee.
AUDREY
(taking charge)
Please, gentlemen. Sit down.
She gestures toward the small round table. They sit.
BEN
We once met during the Mexican War. Do you
remember?
JACOBY
(calling upon high school drama training,
sticking to the script)
I have come to surrender the North.
Ben reacts. Is he the only sane man in the room?
BEN
(trying to carry on an actual conversation)
The Mexican War. Do you remember?

It was a good war as I remember.
BEN
Nonsense. All wars are nothing more than madness

JACOBY
(a little dazed by the outburst)
Me neither.
BEN
(wondering if this can possibly be Grant)
But as for the men who fight them...
(living the moment)
Well. They have my eternal respect and sympathy.
(with a sigh)
Very well, General. Enough fruitless conversation. My
terms. Federal officers may keep their side arms and
general possessions. Officers and men claiming to own
horses may keep them too. And each officer and man
will be allowed to return to his home, not to be
disturbed by the Confederate States' authorities.
JACOBY
(eager to complete the process)
I surrender.
Ben pauses. Rewriting history wasn't supposed to be like this. He sighs.
BEN
Of course you do. The articles ... ?
Ben looks about, no paper on the desk. Jerry hurries forward, having missed his cue.
JERRY
The articles, sire.

Jacoby signs. He hands the pen to Ben. Ben signs as well. Jerry reveals a harmonica, begins to
PLAY the Battle Hymn of the Republic in the background.
BOBBY AND AUDREY look on from the perimeter. Bobby turns to Aubrey.
BOBBY
(sotto voce)
I thought the North won the Civil War...
Aubrey rolls her eyes. Ben and Jacoby stand, shake hands a second time. Jerry steps closer,
playing loudly now. Ben gets fully into the spirit of the moment, tears gather in his eyes, he's
at the pinnacle again, he's triumphed over inestimable odds ... and FAINTS dead away.
AUDREY

Jerry, Jacoby, and Aubrey gather about the fallen General. Jacoby loosens his collar. Bobby
stands just behind them.
JACOBY

AUDREY

28.  MARSH HOUSE - NIGHT
CAMERA TRACKS toward the house, a moving POV, now peering through a window
inside. Evelyn kneels by James on the floor. Malcom enters the living room carrying a pistol in his
right hand. ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Donna looking through the window, reacting to the
horrifying scene within.

29.  MARSH HOUSE - NIGHT
Malcom holds the gun toward Evelyn, grip-end first.
MALCOM
The story rings a little truer with your fingerprints on the
gun.
EVELYN
(rising to her feet)
No. I can't...
MALCOM
Just your prints. Leave the rest to me.
Malcom forces the gun into Evelyn's hand. Then produces a glove, slips it on his right hand.
MALCOM
I'll do my best to imitate the actions of a hysteric. Five
shots, tightly grouped. Like the gun went off in your
hand. Repeatedly.
Glove on, Malcom holds out his hand for the gun. But Evelyn hesitates, steps back from him.
MALCOM
Evelyn...?
Just then: Donna races into the living room.
DONNA
NO!!
Malcom whirls about. Donna races to James, kneels to hold him in her arms. To protect him
from further harm. James stirs, barely conscious.
JAMES

Donna...?

Don't hurt him. Please. Don't hurt him anymore.

MALCOM
She's lying. Give me the gun.
DONNA
(directing her whispered plea toward Evelyn)
Don't do it. Please don't let us die.
MALCOM
(holding out gloved hand for the gun)
Evelyn.
EVELYN
(after a beat, softly)
No.
Malcom whirls about. Finds Evelyn gawking fondly at the young lovers. The gun held tightly
in her hand.
EVELYN
I can't do it. I won't.
There is a transcendant determination in her voice. A soul reclaimed. Malcom darkens.
MALCOM
I will.
He steps forward, means to wrest the gun from Evelyn's hands. But Evelyn FIRES, a bullet
slams into Malcom's chest. He staggers, looks down at the wound with surprise. He steps
toward Evelyn, the gun smoking in her outstretched hand. But his legs fail him. Malcom
staggers, Malcom falls dead to the floor. A beat. Donna weeps, cradles James in her arms.
Evelyn drops the gun. And in a voice totally devoid of emotion, begins to recite the story
Malcom taught her.
EVELYN
He was angry, he was crazy. He killed Jeffrey and he
came back to kill me. But I was ready for him. I got
my gun. And I shot him. I shot him until he was dead...

31.  GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - NIGHT
A man pauses in the hotel lobby. It is Windom Earle in disguise. Earle looks about, reacts. He
SEES Agent Cooper step into view. Earle walks quickly to a pillar nearby, hides behind it.
Meanwhile, Cooper steps through the lobby after a long day. He walks past Earle in hiding,
continues. Then reacts, as if he'd felt someone's eyes upon him. Cooper turns, takes a closer
look... but there is no one to be seen. Earle has moved on. Cooper shrugs, steps inside the
waiting elevator.
A beat. Earle steps to reception, pleased with his subterfuge. He watches the elevator door
close, turns to hand an envelope to the night clerk.
EARLE
For Miss Aubrey Horne.

32.  GREAT NORTHERN ROOM - NIGHT
Cooper enters his room, removes jacket and gun. Then he pauses, notices something ahead. A
strange shape beneath his bedspread where the pillow lies. Cooper steps closer, carefully pulls
it back.
A plaster deathmask has been set upon his pillow. The face of a beautiful woman. Caroline.
Cooper stares at the mask for a long, long beat. His heart floods with sad memory. Then,
careful not to break it, Cooper lifts the mask off his bed. Beneath it ... a small tape recorder,
now activated by the mask's removal. Cooper reacts, waits. And hears the familiar VOICE
of Windom Earle.
EARLE'S VOICE
Breathtaking, wasn't she? A truly beautiful woman,
Caroline. Funny, after all this time, after all that
happened in Pittsburgh ... I still love her. And I know
that you do too ...

1.  SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE - MORNING
CLOSE ON the DEATH MASK laying on the desk. Next to it, the TAPE PLAYER is
broadcasting the VOICE of Windom Earle. PULL BACK to reveal COOPER sitting
opposite TRUMAN - both listening.
EARLE'S VOICE
Now, Dale. Listen carefully. It's your move. And please, put your heart
into it, will you? I've noticed a certain tentative quality in your thinking, as
if your mind were occupied with issues other than those on the board
before you. Such preoccupation not only weakens one's resolve, but one's
foresight as well. A deadly failing in any match, you must agree. But in
this particular contest, quite disasterous, as we play for grave stakes, the
likes of which you have no doubt surmised.
(stern and cold)
Print your move in tomorrow's paper. Or I will make it for you.
TRUMAN (the tape runs out)
Cooper, I'm not letting you out of my sight.
COOPER
If Windom wanted to kill me, I'd already be dead. Get
Pete on the phone.
TRUMAN (into intercom)
Lucy, call Pete Martel, tell him to get over here, then call
the paper, find out the latest possible deadline for
tomorrow's personal column.
Truman turns off the intercom looking up at Cooper. But Cooper's staring at the mask...

Please, God help me, please, confine your singing to the
shower. Salt and pepper...?

Okay, Poodle, comin' right up.
Pete goes into the kitchen, still laughing.
CATHERINE

He and Andrew try to slap the other on the head, each ducking out of the way - their age-proof
goodbye, then Pete, in a burst of familial enthusiasm, kisses Catherine on the cheek.

tomorrow.
CATHERINE
Andrew... I've been thinking... about a shopping mall.
ANDREW

CATHERINE (with relish)
No, right next to the Great Northern. Adjacent to the
new hotel I want to build.
ANDREW

Oh, good. Company.
The back door opens and JOSIE walks in carrying a bundle of kindling. She stops cold,
staring at Andrew - it can't be. She drops the wood, and moves closer, eyes wide with horror.
ANDREW
Dear Josie. I'm home. Did you miss me?
Josie PASSES OUT cold. Neither Andrew or Catherine move. Pause.

KNOCK on the door. HAWK opens the door wide, making enough room for himself and
HANK, who hobbles in, handcuffed to his crutches. Truman tenses, in no mood for this.
HANK

Hello, Harry.
Hank makes a mock attempt to shake hands - making a po Truman gives him a long look.
TRUMAN
Save it, Hank.
HANK
Jeez, did you get up on the wrong side of the bed this
morning? I broke parole! Cry me a river.
TRUMAN
You crossed the border into Canada, we have photographs
of you consorting with felons at Dead Dog Farm and I'm
charging you with the attempted murder of Leo Johnson.
HANK
Ouch. Okay. Well. I think it's safe to assume that I was
at the diner the night Leo was plugged, but you're
welcome to -
TRUMAN
I've got a witness puts you at the scene with a gun in your
hand. You are one cat that just used up his ninth life.
HANK
(pause, playing his trump card)
Harry, you obviously seem serious about this, so I'm
going to modestly propose a trade. How about
information leading to the arrest and conviction of
Andrew Packard's murderer. Hank Jennings, witness for
the prosecution.
TRUMAN
No deals.
HANK
You're going to tell me you care more about the
attempted murder of Leo Johnson, felon, than you do
about Andrew Packard? How's that gonna go over with
your constituents -

Truman goes white with rage. Pause. Hawk kicks out one of Hank's crutches, he goes down.
HAWK
Gee, I sorry.
Hank's on the floor, gasping with pain.
TRUMAN
Get him out of my sight.
Hawk hurries to remove Hank. Truman collapses in his chair: it can't be true.

COOPER

COOPER

ALBERT
Maybe she'll grow wings and join the circus.

5.  GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY
AUDREY, dressed for success, walks across the lobby carrying a stack of manila file folders
to the Concierge Desk, where the concierge, EMILE LAZARE, officiates.
AUDREY
(eager to pitch in)
Emile, I've got a list of all our "non-repeat" guests. We're
going to send them a special invitation from the Great
Northern.
Emile shoves an AUDREY name tag toward her as she sits down. He smiles thinly,
supercillious:
EMILE
Your enthusiasm brings a salty tear to the eye. However, I
think you will find my job requires more than tight
sweaters and a perky attitude.
AUDREY
(trying to be pleasant, putting on tag)
Emile, I'm learning the business, every week a different
department. I don't want your job.
EMILE
I look forward to your stint in housekeeping.
(hands her an envelope)
This came for you this morning. Good luck, Miss Horne.
You'll need it.
Emile turns his back and walks away. Audrey glares after, hurt, angry. She rips open the
envelope. A voice intrudes:

Audrey finally looks up, right into the smoldering eyes of JOHN JUSTICE WHEELER -
full on knock-down-drag-out handsome. Wheeler meets her glare with a friendly smile.
Simple, uncomplicated.
WHEELER
Sorry. I thought you were working.
AUDREY
I am working. See?
Audrey slaps her hands through the papers and files atop the concierge desk. Tantrum
exorcised, she looks back to the handsome stranger, manages a more business-like mien.
WHEELER

Audrey ... Horne?
AUDREY

WHEELER

Good. I need a fax machine installed in my room as soon
as possible.
AUDREY

with)
I can handle that.

Audrey looks at him - blue jeans, t-shirt, cowboy boots - a jet!? She deadpans:
AUDREY
Is there anything else I can do for you, Mr. Rockefeller?
WHEELER
No. That's all for now. Thanks.
Wheeler steps away. Audrey takes a closer look. Wheeler pivots, smiles.
WHEELER
I have a picture of you. Little dirndl skirt, white apron,
long braids. Unbelievably cute.
AUDREY
I don't wear dirndl.
WHEELER
You did then. Right here in the Great Northern dining
room. If I close my eyes I can almost see it. Audrey
Horne as "Heidi". Unforgettable.
AUDREY
"Heidi"?
(remembering, mortified)
I was ten. How did you...? Hey!
Too late. Wheeler's gone. Audrey watches him step through the lobby, anger now leavened
with curiosity. A beat. She looks down at the envelope. Pulls out a vertically torn piece of
paper, reading part of a POEM:
I have dreamed
walked so much
I have to do now
Phantoms and a ghost
Ghost who walks

With it, a separate INVITATION: Save the One you Love. Please attend gathering of Angels

up. And as soon as my parents come home, it'd probably
be best if you moved back in with your folks. Eddie... I
am so sorry.
Ed nods. He's not, but he's straining not to show it.

7.  BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
Josie and Cooper sit on the couch. Josie's fidgets nervously, won't look Cooper in the eye.
COOPER
Josie, this is your last chance to level with me about what
happened in Seattle.
JOSIE
(she doesn't)
I told you, how many times do I have to say it, I escaped
from Jonathan at the airport. After that, I don't know
what happened to him.
COOPER
Do you understand that I could arrest you right now?
Josie cowers.

8.  BLUE PINE KITCHEN
Catherine is glued to the door, listening to every word. Delighted.

9.  BLUE PINE LIVING ROOM
COOPER
I'm here as a friend... of Harry's. I don't know what place
he occupies in your heart, but I know you own his.
Wouldn't you want a chance to try and explain this to him
before -
JOSIE
Please go.
Josie looks away. Cooper stands.
COOPER
There's nowhere for you to run.
(pauses, dreading it)
I'll give you until six. If you're not at the station house by
then, I'll come back for you.
He leaves. Josie doesn't move, the noose tightens.
Catherine pretends to have just come in the back door. She sashays through the living room.
CATHERINE
Josie! I just saw Agent Cooper leave, was this a social
call?
Josie doesn't respond, staring into space.
CATHERINE (Cont'd)
Dear, you look awful. Is everything all right?
JOSIE
(standing, shakey)
I don't feel well.
CATHERINE
I'm sorry. Well, I wish I had better news. I've spoken to
Mr. Eckhardt again, on your behalf. He's not entirely
unsympathetic, but he does insist on seeing you alone.
Tonight.
JOSIE
(beaten)
He'll kill me.
(CONTINUED)
#2.016 12.

CATHERINE
To tell you the truth, my biggest worry is what he'll do if
he finds out that Andrew is alive. Won't Mr. Eckhardt
think you betrayed him?
(then fake cheer)
But of course you can always plead ignorance; after all,
you did think Andrew was dead.
Josie holds her head, truly being driven crazy.
JOSIE
Catherine, please. Help me. I don't know what to do. I
feel like I'm going mad...
CATHERINE
Josie, you're going to have to face Mr. Eckhardt sooner or
later. Tell him the truth. Tell him anything you desire.
Just pray he'll believe it. Now where did I leave my
keys....?
Catherine rustles through a draw desk drawer, reveals a HANDGUN. She grabs her keys, steps
away. Josie pauses, stricken, eyes locked on the weapon. A beat. And she reaches for it.
Catherine stops to glance back at Josie from across the room. She smiles.

10.  GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY
THOMAS ECKHARDT, hands his assistant, JONES, a stack of CASH. Her suitcase is
open on the bed.
ECKHARDT
The entire amount.
(Jones reacts, pleased)
I trust you'll finish the job, regardless of what happens
tonight.
(he catches her hand as she takes the money)
Surely you of all people know what happens when my trust
is violated.
He pulls a GAROTTE out of her bracelet, wraps it around her wrists. Kisses her.
ECKHARDT
Check out. Drive north, for a day. I'll wrap up my affairs
and be gone by morning. Come back tomorrow night and
finish up.
JONES

Yes sir.

11.  BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
Order has been restored. Around the conference table are the GREAT NORTHERN
BOARD MEMBERS: BEN, Audrey, and JERRY, who is making black olive paste canapes.
BOBBY BRIGGS stands next to Ben's desk, hanging up a phone.
BOBBY
No answer, Ben. He must be on his way.
BEN
(calm and affable)
Thank you, lad. Join us, will you? Board Meetings are
usually nothing more than a gathering of self-minded
individuals more intent than the next on financial
gain. But today, well, today will be something
completely different.
Bobby hurries to his seat. Audrey smiles at the new eager beaver, as the door opens behind her.
BEN
Ahh. Here he is now. Jack, you're a sight for sore eyes.
Are we taking good care of you?
Audrey reacts, stunned to see the man with the jet, now dressed in a beautiful Armani suit.
Ben embraces Wheeler like a long-lost son. Wheeler smiles at Audrey.
WHEELER
My luggage just arrived. Thank you, Audrey.
BEN
You two have met?
AUDREY
(a little cold)
Briefly.
BEN
(by way of introduction)
John Justice Wheeler. Used to work construction, came up
the hard way.
AUDREY
How nice for him.

BEN

Jack, take a seat, you know brother Jerry, of course, and
this is my executive assistant, young Bob Briggs.
Wheeler sits down between Bobby and Audrey. Audrey takes a wary look at the stranger. He
returns a smile. Jerry passes his canapes around. And Ben clears his throat, begins:
BEN
I've asked Mr. Wheeler to our board. Years ago, I
invested in him, a pittance he built into an empire. I take
no credit. But I believed in Jack, even when he was just
another local boy pounding nails. I have asked him to
return the favor by believing, in me now.
Wheeler nods assent. Ben pauses with requisite drama, at least long enough for Jerry to finish
chomping on a rather hefty canape... and begins:
BEN
(slowly pacing around them)
Horne Industries Incorporated have fallen on hard times.
The mill and Ghostwood lands are now solely owned by
Catherine Martell. We don't begrudge her the mill, it was
and is, after all, hers. But we sweated blood to make
Ghostwood ours for a doggone decade. Retail revenues at
the department store are down fourteen percent. And as
for the hotel, well, let's just say it's off-season and leave it
at that.
JERRY
Ben, over in Sicily, I had a marketing brainstorm. We set
up a special package deal: Twin Peaks, Land of Crime.
See where Laura Palmer was murdered, see where her
body was found, visit Maddy Ferguson's final resting
place; I call it the Homicide Getaway -

Everyone looks at Jerry like he's lost his mind.
BEN
Thank you, Jer. We'll put it on the agenda for further
review.
(carrying on)
But in spite of these reversals, stripped of the trappings of
success, what are we left with? The human spirit. I've been
taking a good hard look at my own soul, and I've decided
it's high time Ben Horne gave something back to society.
JERRY
Ben, not the hotel.
BEN
No. Not the hotel. What's the greatest gift one human
being can give to another? The future.
He goes over to a DRAPED EASEL in the corner, and removes the cloth, revealing a large
Audobon-style drawing of a WEASEL.
BEN
I give you... the pine weasel - found only in our tri-county
area. Targeted by the Environmental Defense League and
the Wilderness Society. Nearly extinct.
JERRY
They're incredible roasted. A ginger and garlic
marinade, a glass of sauvignon blanc -
BEN
(cutting him off)
According to an environmental impact report I
commissioned, what few pine weasels remain...
(as though Jerry had eaten them all)
... will be all but wiped out by the Packard plans for
Ghostwood development.

BOBBY

You wanna "save the pine weasel"?
BEN
Not just the pine weasel. Life as we know it. I want
Twin Peaks to remain unspoiled in an era of vast
environmental carnage.
AUDREY
But development is progress: people, money.
WHEELER
Not always. Ben if I could interrupt -
BEN
Please, Jack.
WHEELER
What Ben's talking about is quality of life, something we
don't consider much in the business world. It's my
experience that a corporation like Horne Industries is not
just a vehicle for making money, but for expressing values
too.
Audrey looks at Wheeler, irked by the interruption, interested too.
JERRY
(whispering to Ben)
So we block Catherine's development until the wheel turns
and we get another shot. Brilliant Ben, brilliant.
BEN
(stands, takes the floor again)
I intend to fight the Ghostwood development on every
ground with every available weapon. This little weasel is
about to become a household word.
AUDREY
Then what?
Ben leans back, taking them all in.
BEN
(earnest)
I'm considering a run for the Senate.

12.  DOUBLE R DINER - DAY
SHELLY clears tables. ONE MAN sits at the counter finishing up. We MOVE IN to see
that it's WINDOM EARLE, dressed like a TRUCK DRIVER: baseball hat, flannel shirt,
jacket, and dirty jeans. He leaves some money on the counter - and an ENVELOPE.
ANGLE ON NORMA
Talking on the phone. In the background, we see Windom Earle leave.
NORMA
...Annie, it's no problem, really. I've got plenty of room.
You get on the next bus and I'll be waiting.
(listening)
Okay, honey, don't cry. Things will be fine. I'll see you
soon. I love you too. Bye.
She hangs up. Shelly brings a load of dirty dishes over.
SHELLY
So is she coming?
NORMA
Tomorrow.
SHELLY
God, what do you have to do to get out of a convent?
NORMA
Leave. It's not a prison.
SHELLY
Sure sounds like it to me.
(half-joking)
No TV. No boyfriends.
NORMA

When she was little I always thought Annie was from
another time and place. The convent was right for her, in a

The door flies open and BIG ED strides in - a man on a mission. Norma's face lights up. Ed
doesn't speak, he takes Norma's hand and leads her out from behind the counter and into his
arms. Shelly watches, wide-eyed.
ED
Norma, I've loved you every day for the past twenty years

13.  WOODS - DAY
LEO sits on a tree stump, whittling a long, thin piece of wood, the SHOCK COLLAR around
Leo's neck. WINDOM EARLE walks over, pats him on the back, like a dog.
EARLE
Good job, fella.
Leo doesn't react, just keeps whittling.
EARLE (Cont'd)
Just a few more, then we'll eat.
Earle picks up one of the shafts, sings a snatch of an Irish drinking song, then ...
EARLE (Cont'd)
"Fly to my breast, pierce me in colors autumnal/Speak to
me only of love."
Leo looks at him uncomprehendingly. Earle looks back.
EARLE
Leo, you have an incomplete education.
(puts an arm around him)
For instance, survival in the wilderness a relevant issue
in your life, my friend. This comes under the heading of
practical instruction. I hope you've been paying attention.
From his pocket, he takes a DEADLY ARROWHEAD, knifepoint gleaming, and affixes it to
the shaft: an arrow. Leo gets the idea, smiles.
EARLE (Cont'd)
Nature is cruel. This is also ... a lesson.

First let me say I don't blame you. You gave me a second
chance. I blew it. I don't know why I'm so selfdestructive, but I can see now that's got to be my priority
in getting well. I've got a lot of work to do. In fact, I
decided I'm going to try to go into therapy - I don't
want to be like this anymore.
Hank closes his eyes, as though fighting back tears.
NORMA
Hank, that's... interesting. But I have to go on with my

HANK
I know. I know you do. And I want you be be happy.
NORMA

Thank you.
HANK
I want to ask you one last favor. I want you to help me get
out of here. If they send me back to prison I'll die. Just
tell the Sheriff I was at the restaurant the night Leo was
shot. I was on my way there, but I can't prove it. You can.

TRUMAN
Maybe it'll just frustrate him, maybe he'll kill anyway.
COOPER
I don't think so Earle has a sense of honor about these
things, however perverse.
TRUMAN
I never heard of a man who murdered by the rules.
Albert sticks his head in the door - motioning for Cooper.

Albert leads Cooper all the way down to the other end of the hall - then faces him.
ALBERT
I've got a match on the gun that whacked you to powder
residue on Josie Packard's gloves. Seattle police have also
come up with an eyewitness who positively id'd Josie
leaving the car where they found the stiff. Now if you're
not gonna bust the bitch, I'll consider it a personal

her door.
JOSIE
Come in.
Andrew enters, carrying, TWO GLASSES of CHAMPAGNE.
ANDREW
I assume you still have a taste for bubbly. We killed
enough bottles in our time.
Josie takes it, confused by his kindness. He raises his glass.
ANDREW

To beginnings ... and endings. And the wisdom to know
the difference.
JOSIE

Andrew, I'm ... sorry.
ANDREW
At first I hated you for it. Perfectly normal response. As
my anger subsided I recalled that Eckhardt has a way of
pursuading people to do ... anything. I assume it was his idea.
JOSIE
He said that you never loved me, that you just married
me to get back at him.
ANDREW
That's not true. I did love you very much. But of course,
I'm afraid the same could never be said for you.

Now you're paying the price. Every action has it's
consequences, my dear.
Josie looks at him, questioning.
ANDREW (Cont'd)
The police are closing in. If you don't take action, you'll
be sleeping in a jail cell tonight.
JOSIE
What can I do?... help me.
ANDREW
You must see Eckhardt. Perhaps you were meant to be
together all along. I truly believe that he loves you. He
doesn't know I'm alive. And he can get you out of the
country. Go to him, Josie. Now.
Josie nods her head, downs the rest of her champagne, literally shaking with fright. She starts
to speak again.
ANDREW (Cont'd)
Don't say anything. Let me just remember you this way.
We won't speak again.
He rises, looks at Josie one last time - so beautiful, so pathetic. Then he leaves.

17.  MOUNTAIN - LATE AFTERNOON
Nature at it's best. DONNA sits on a quilt next to a basket of wine, cheese, and crackers. We

Listen to me. I know what you were feeling, because I was
feeling it too. And I believe Evelyn took advantage of
that.
JAMES
It was wrong. I should have known it was.
DONNA
James. You can feel bad about what happened for you. But
I don't want you to feel bad for me.
JAMES

I love you.
They come together in a healing embrace, remain in each other's arms throughout. A long beat,
then, quiet and sad:
DONNA
I remember when I thought love was simple. But look at
us. Nothing we do seems to matter. Maybe love isn't
enough.
JAMES
If we could just start over...
DONNA

Come home with me.
JAMES

she brought him here.

be part of something good. Go, James. Take all the time
you need.
Donna pauses, determined not to cry. She reaches in her pocket, and pulls out an ENVELOPE.
DONNA
It's not much, but what's babysitting money for, if you
can't buy your best friend a present.
(smiles, wipes away a fugitive tear)
I'll miss you like crazy, but you'll come back and tell me
a bunch of great stories. And none of them will be about
Laura, or Maddy, or Evelyn. I'll be here. And we can
start over again.
JAMES
Come with me.
DONNA (gently)

PETE

He shuffles over to the door, and opens it on a very distraught Sheriff Truman.
TRUMAN
Pete, I need to see Josie.
PETE
C'mon in. I think she went out.
CATHERINE

Yes, Sheriff, it's a little odd. She took my car, without

PETE
She told me the Great Northern.
CATHERINE

Eckhardt is shocked. The doors close. Andrew pushes a button to stop the car between floors.
Eckhardt reaches for a gun.
ANDREW
That won't be necessary. As unlikely as it may sound, I'm

unarmed. Look if you like.

holds the gun)
Very well, then. If it makes you more comfortable.

Guess. It's really very simple.
ECKHARDT

ECKHARDT (his obsession tolls)
She's mine. She belongs to me.

Oh, Thomas. Love will break your heart. Happily, I long
ago lost interest. But Josie, she gives her heart with
alarming regularity. The local sheriff, of all people.
ECKHARDT
I took care of that.
ANDREW
I don't doubt it. Sometimes I wonder if our Josie does
these twisted things deliberately. Don't you?
(Eckhardt reins in fury; Andrew lies with a sigh)
I do regret that our friendship had to end over someone
so... inconstant. Josie's unpredictable nature is part of her
charm, to be sure. Especially to men like us, so set in our
ways. But as I grow older, I find myself placing more
value in simple, unadorned, trust.

Audrey nearly chokes on her dessert. Ben pats her on the back.
AUDREY (suspicious)
What exactly do you do, Mr. Wheeler?
WHEELER
Call me Jack. I buy bankrupt, failing businesses,
streamline them, bring them up to speed, and then,
usually, sell them.
BEN
And at a substantial profit. But not, I should add, before
making significant environmental concessions. When
Jack's finished, the waste is re-routed, the air cleaner, the
people happier.

And so you came back to bring us all up to speed. You are
Santa Claus, Mister Wheeler. I better hang my stocking.
WHEELER (after a beat)
You don't like me much, do you Audrey?
AUDREY
I don't have an opinion either way.
WHEELER
But if you did?
AUDREY (cool and calm)
If I did, I'd say that the Hornes have managed to take care
of themselves just fine for more years than you can count.
And, desperate though we may seem, will probably
continue to do so in the foreseeable future.
Audrey's matching his direct tone, adding a little bit of her father's flamboyance. She waits
for Wheeler to respond, react. A beat. And he begins to laugh.
AUDREY
What's so funny?
(CONTINUED)
#2.016 33.
20. CONTINUED:(2)
WHEELER
I was just remembering. Heidi, it's no big deal...
AUDREY
Heidi again. I was ten, I don't know what that has to do
with anything...
WHEELER (remembering)
Somehow, Ben convinced Pete Martell to play the Goat.
He had these horns on, and you know Pete, he'd bleat and
baah to wake the dead, loud enough that we couldn't hear
poor Heidi's lines. So you kicked him. Hard. Right
where he lives, as I recall...
AUDREY (now laughing too)
I didn't mean to hurt him...
WHEELER(more gently)
Pete started yowling even louder, for real this time, and
precious, innocent little Heidi turned to the audience, pigtails and deep dark eyes...and smiled. Ten years old and
you made it very clear: Don't tread on me.
(beat)
Sorry. It's just that a minute ago I was starting to feel
like one of Heidi's goats. Sparked a memory.
AUDREY
(charmed in spite of herself)
Where have you been all this time? I mean, when you
weren't rescuing widows and orphans and making our
world a better place to live in.
WHEELER
The far corners of the earth. It's glorious out there,
Audrey. But all in all, it's nice be back home.
Wheeler says it simply, without affect. Audrey's never met a man like him before. With a
single exception ... Agent Cooper. And that goes straight to the heart of her.
(CONTINUED)
#2.016 34.
20. CONTINUED:(3)
AUDREY (sotto voce)
I'm only eighteen.
WHEELER (puzzled)
Excuse me?
AUDREY (snapping, out of it)
Nothing. I, uhm... look at the time. Tell my father,
okay? I've got an appointment. See you... Jack
Flustered, not sure exactly what she's feeling, Audrey makes a sudden exit. Wheeler sits back,
as fascinated now as he was back then ... and watches her go.

21.  ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
Shelly sits at the bar, sipping a BEER. Alone, not sure what she's waiting for. Donna walks out
of the LADIES ROOM and sees Shelly. Donna goes over.
DONNA
Hi Shelly.
SHELLY
Hi, how are you doing?
DONNA
How are you doing?
SHELLY
Okay. You know, life.
DONNA
Yeah.
(Shelly offers a cigarette)
No thanks.
SHELLY
Waiting for James?
DONNA
No, I got this weird note. Asked me to meet somebody
here.
She lays her torn piece of paper on the bar. Shelly looks at it.
SHELLY
That's weird all right.
She takes out her own piece of paper, and lays it down next to Donna's. Two pieces of the same
puzzle. Then a THIRD PIECE OF PAPER is laid down next to the other two - the puzzle is
complete.
(CONTINUED)
#2.016 35.
21. CONTINUED:
They look up - it's Audrey.
AUDREY
Looks like we have all something to talk about.
DONNA
They fit together.
SHELLY
(reading the pieced together poem)
I have dreamed so much of you
walked so much, spoken, lain with your phantom...
That all I have to do now perhaps is to be a phantom
among phantoms and a ghost hundred times...
More than the ghost who walks gaily over the sun-dial of
your life.
CAMERA MOVE to reveal Windom Earle, in disguise, sitting in another part of the
Roadhouse watching them.

22.  GREAT NORTHERN LOBBY - NIGHT
Sheriff Truman strides through the lobby over to the HOUSE PHONE. He picks it up.
TRUMAN
(into phone)
Agent Cooper, please.

23.  COOPER'S ROOM
Cooper's loading his pistol. The PHONE RINGS, he uncoils, answering it.
COOPER
Cooper ... yes, Catherine. No, I was just on my way out
there - she's here now? Thomas Eckhardt, all right ...
Truman still on the phone.
OPERATOR'S VOICE
(from phone)
I'm sorry, that line is still busy.
Truman hangs up and heads for the elevators.

24.  HOTEL CORRIDOR
Cooper walks down a hall and around a corner. We HEAR SHOUTING. Cooper moves
more quickly.
(CONTINUED)
#2.016 36.
24. CONTINUED:
MAN'S VOICE
(from inside one of the rooms)
Say it, SAY YOU DON'T LOVE HIM!!
Cooper now stands outside the door.
WOMAN'S VOICE
No! Not as long as I live...
MAN'S VOICE
Then you won't.
Cooper kicks the door open - just as a SHOT is FIRED.

25.  ECKHARDT'S SUITE
Cooper bursts in on Josie lying on the bed with Eckhardt, both faces frozen, eyes wide open.
It's not clear who's done what to whom. Eckhardt rises from the bed, starts towards Cooper, a
knife in his hand. Then Cooper sees the blood seeping from the wand in his chest. Eckhardt
stops. A pause.
Josie pulls her arm out from under the covers - pointing the smoking GUN at Cooper.
Eckhardt collapses.
Josie holds the gun on Cooper. She's wearing traditional CHINESE PEASANT clothes that
are half open, half off. No make-up, looking more like the girl she used to be.
JOSIE
He tried ... he tried to kill me.
COOPER
Is that what you'll say about me? Josie, I'm not armed.
Behind Cooper, Truman steps through the open door - unseen, but listening.
COOPER
What about Jonathan? Was he trying to kill you too?
JOSIE
He was taking me back
Truman draws his gun.
COOPER
And me. Why did you shoot me, Josie?
JOISE
You asked too many questions. I knew this day was

Truman steps out into the room, points his gun at Josie.
TRUMAN
Put it down, Josie.
Josie can't bear to look at Truman. Tears roll down her face, but the gun holds steady.
TRUMAN
Put it down.
JOSIE
Harry, forgive me. I had no right to hurt you ...
She cocks the gun. Still pointed at Cooper.
TRUMAN
(cocking his own gun)
I'm begging you. Don't make me do this.
She looks at him one more time. Whispers goodbye. She turns the gun on herself. Her hand
starts shaking. She exhales sharply, twice, her body seizes up and she collapses on the floor.
Truman rushes to her.
TRUMAN
Josie? Josie!
(he turns to Cooper)
She's dead.
Cooper looks at them and senses something more:

26. COOPER'S POV
Josie and Truman disappear. A bright light appears in the room. In a hole in that light
Cooper sees the Little Man from his dream, dancing by, then replaced by the face of Bob,
laughing demonically. That image fades... Truman reappears, kneeling down, holding the
body of Josie. Cooper continues to watch-them, trying to make sense of what he's seen.

27. ANOTHER ANGLE
CAMERA drifts over to a chest of drawers, settling on a circular drawer pull. The grain of
the wood seems to waver momentarily and shift and in it we see the tortured, screaming
features of Josie.

1.  BOOKHOUSE - DAY
Establish.
2.  BOOKHOUSE
OPEN ON TRUMAN sitting at a table in the bookshelved alcove. Playing from the bar
area, we HEAR Muddy Waters, I Just Want to Make Love to You. Truman is sleepless and
unshaven; his thoughts also appear to be growing a little wild. Before him is a half-empty
bottle of Canadian whiskey and an overturned, unused shot glass, which Truman lazily twirls.
HAWK enters carrying a box which he places in front the sheriff. He opens the box: it's a
packed Diner breakfast. Truman looks up at Hawk indifferently.
HAWK
One of Norma's breakfasts. Made special.
TRUMAN
(pushing it aside, he takes a drink)
Maybe later.
Hawk says nothing, but his look lingers for a moment.
TRUMAN
How's things at the station?
HAWK
Earle's chess game is the big concern. Man has a poor sense
of recreation.
A brief beat. As these are his vacation days, the same could obviously be said of Truman.
HAWK
We're holding up. For now.
TRUMAN
Cooper can handle it.
(beat)
It's a pretty simple town. Used to be, anyway. Maybe
the world's just caught up to it.
And perhaps also to Truman. Hawk gives the sheriff a Bookhouse salute, and goes, his receding
bootsteps slowed by concern.

START ON an attractive YOUNG WOMAN as she enters the Double R carrying a small
suitcase. She looks about, tentative, then spots NORMA stepping into view.
YOUNG WOMAN
Norma!
NORMA
(sees her, brightens)
Annie ...
It's Norma's sister, ANNIE BLACKBURNE. Norma comes around the counter to offer a
welcoming embrace. Annie receives it with relief, some hesitation. She's got a lot on her
mind. SHELLY comes out from the kitchen, carrying an order.
NORMA
Shelly, this is my sister, Annie.
SHELLY
Welcome, Annie. Norma's told me all about you.
Shelly, with an order in hand, spins away. Annie looks at her sister.
ANNIE
(a rueful smile)
All ... about me?
NORMA
Shelly's like family.
ANNIE
With our family that's not exactly a character reference.
NORMA
(gets the idea)
How did you and mom get along?
ANNIE
We can talk about her, or we can feel good about things.
I vote for plan B.
NORMA
Me, too. I'm glad you're here.
ANNIE
Feels a little strange. The real world. Little things.
Like I'd almost forgotten how to use money. Closest
we'd get in the convent was bingo chips.

No charity, Norma. Promise.

CAMERA DRIFTS OVER to Shelly, who's just lowered the special in front of her customer,
MAJOR BRIGGS, and has waited a moment for him to sample.
BRIGGS
(nods)
Compelling.
Reasonably satisfied this isn't a complaint, she tentatively smiles and moves away. The LOG
LADY enters, passing behind Briggs at the counter and slowing to sit next to him. She then
suddenly stops behind the Major, staring down into his neck.
5. LOG LADY'S POV - BRIGGS
On the back of his neck, just above the high military collar, is a strange small marking,
consisting of three joined inverted triangles.
The Log Lady stares at the marking for a long beat. Then, as if touching some ancient rune,
reaches out, places two fingers upon it. Major Briggs feels her touch, swivels to face her.

6.  SHERIFF'S STATION - TRUMAN'S OFFICE - DAY
DALE COOPER, in full deputy dress, sits at Truman's desk, looking over several piles of
paperwork. At a corner of the desk is a copy of the Twin Peaks Gazette, opened to the
Personals section. Hawk enters.
HAWK
Harry's about to hit bottom.
COOPER
Is he eating?
(Hawk shakes his head)
His vacation days'll be used up soon. Think he'll come
back to work?
HAWK
Guess we'll find out. Give you a hand?
COOPER
That's a question I should be asking you.
HAWK
You're the senior lawman, Cooper. Let's let the rain fall

Besides. I hate paperwork.

COOPER
This is worse than the bureau, all the international

(reaches for a folder)
Have you seen Doc Hayward's autopsy on her? Says he
couldn't determine cause of death. And the body
weighed sixty-five pounds.
HAWK
How is that possible?
COOPER
I don't know. Maybe something to do with what I saw in
the room when she died.
HAWK
Maybe we'd better just whistle on our way past the
graveyard.
COOPER
Yeah.
HAWK
Anything on Earle?
COOPER
That trail's completely cold.
(grimly)
We'll have to wait for his response.

7.  GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - DAY
Hectic preparations for tonight's fashion show benefit for Stop Ghostwood. Amidst the
workers still building the runway, AUDREY HORNE rehearses and directs the models.
RICHARD TREMAYNE, the peacockish host, is accomplishing nothing outside of a skillful
job of smoking. He sidles up to a couple idle MODELS, who stand in requisite boredom,
awaiting further instructions, or romantic rescue.
TREMAYNE
Ladies, may I say you'll both delightfully represent the
sanctity of nature.

Cigarette?
MODEL
I like to keep my chest clear.

Audrey comes up to Tremayne, irritated by his utter uselessness.
AUDREY
Have you spoken with Pinkle?
TREMAYNE
What's a Pinkle?
AUDREY
He's going to give a talk on the Pine Weasel.
(blank)
The endangered animal.
TREMAYNE
Oh. Lovely. What is it? A raccoon or something?
AUDREY
A ferret.
(looking out)
There he is.
TIM PINKLE, of Tim and Tom's Taxidermy approaches, carrying a large stuffed Pine
Weasel under one arm. His plaid jacket looks almost like a taxidermy that didn't take.
AUDREY
You two should coordinate.
TREMAYNE
You are dreaming.
Audrey turns away and runs straight into JOHN JUSTICE WHEELER. She is momentarily,
uncharacteristically, schoolgirlishly flustered.
WHEELER
Hello, Audrey.
(gazing about)
You look like you're trying to run lumber upstream.
AUDREY
(seeking safer terrain)
How may I help you, Mr. Wheeler?

Well, I was thinking about our talk last night...

WHEELER
My fault entirely.
Audrey and Wheeler drift closer, casting sentences at each other.
AUDREY
...get a little excitable, that's all.
WHEELER
Who am I to waltz in here out of nowhere...
AUDREY
We need help, anyone can see that...
WHEELER
... as if your father didn't have enough help already....
AUDREY
... and I can't think of anyone better qualified for the job
than you...
Suddenly, Wheeler stops, removes himself from the back and forth. Audrey takes note, looks
up at him. Wheeler smiles.
WHEELER
Hello.
AUDREY
(a little dreamy)
What're we talking about anyway?
WHEELER
I was apologizing. You were apologizing. We're both
real sorry...

Do you ... want to go somewhere...?

WHEELER
I'll bet there's someone in the kitchen who does.
CAMERA PICKS UP Tremayne and Pinkle, passing by.
PINKLE
(proferring the stuffed animal)
It's just so people can see what a Pine Weasel looks like.
TRUMAN
I understand the concept perfectly, Mr. Twinkle.
PINKLE
Pinkle. The name is Pinkle.
TREMAYNE
But what I'm trying to make clear to you is that using a
stuffed animal to represent an endangered species at an
ecological protest constitutes the supreme incongruity.
PINKLE
Yeah, that's real clear, Dick...

8.  WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
OPEN ON a work desk on which sit three stainless steel suitcases. One of them, a makeup
case, is open. Propped against its standing half is the photograph of a bearded, bespectacled
young man with white bushy eyebrows. SOUND of an irregular wheeze of breathing: PAN
ACROSS THE ROOM to where LEO JOHNSON awkwardly reaches down into a closet,
emerging with... Windom Earle's slippers. One in each hand. He shuffles into the living room,
up to the easy chair where Windom sits.
LEO
Slip...
WINDOM
Slippers.

Earle's tone makes Leo look up suddenly, anticipating a shock. But none is coming. SHOT
CLOSES ON Earle as we hear Leo moving away.
EARLE
You know Leo, you really can't appreciate how tonic
country life is until you're actually right here living it.
A concurring GRUNT from OFF SCREEN. Leo approaches again, carrying Earle's pipe.
LEO
Pipe...
EARLE
Splendid.
(takes the pipe; Leo goes)
Even if you've been in the country before, when you
imagine what it would be like to go back... the image is
imperfect. The mental image is always imperfect. Am
I right?
Leo arrives again with the day's paper, flinching at Earle's look.
EARLE (CONT'D)
Tacit agreement is acceptable, Leo. Your silence speaks
volumes.
(takes the paper and opens it)
Or if not volumes at least the occasional, unpunctuated
paragraph.
Leo sits on a small crate purposely positioned at Earle's right hand. Leo's spot.
EARLE (CONT'D)
Let's see what move our poor Cooper's come up with this
time...
After finding the chess move, Earle's eyes stay on the page a beat. He then leans over to the
chess board on his other side and makes the communicated move. A long survey of the board.
Looks up with great displeasure. Leo gazes at him as we might an overcast sky.
EARLE (CONT'D)
This isn't a move. This is a trick.
(gazing at Leo)
He's playing a stalemate game.
(Leo's confused return stare)
Cooper doesn't know the meaning of stalemate...
(cool fury)
He's getting help.
Earle reaches for his Samurai flute. Leo knows it isn't to play: this is not a musical moment.
CLOSE ON the flute, held high and swaying in the air.

EARLE (CONT'D)
I have no tolerance for people who don't play by the rules.
People who shirk the standards.
The flute comes crashing down on Leo's head. He wimpers in discomfort.
EARLE (CONT'D)
Many people are going to regret this.
He lifts the flute again. Leo cowers. But Earle merely raises it to his mouth. And plays.
CLOSE ON a glistening emerald ring on Earle's left hand. THEN PULL BACK, framing
this little domestic tableau.

She's also been a wanted for a variety of felonies in Hong
Kong.
TRUMAN

improved Ghostwood development. She hears a faint rustling sound, looks up ... and sees
JONES standing across the room.
JONES
The door was open.
CATHERINE
(cool and calm)
A country habit. We're all so trusting.
JONES
My name is Jones, I was exec executive assistant to the late Mr.
Eckhardt.
Catherine gestures to a chair, carefully watches her guest take a seat. Jones has a satchel purse,
which Catherine is also watching.
JONES
Thank you. I've come to expedite the transport of his
body back to Hong Kong.

want?)
Tragic, what happened. You know, he really did love
Josie.
CATHERINE

JONES
I came here to give you a gift.
(motioning to her purse)
May I?
CATHERINE
I don't think so.
(motioning)
Empty it.
Jones complies, emptying her large purse onto the couch beside her. Out fall no guns or
weapons of any kind, just women 's minutiae, save one very mysterious looking black box.
Jones picks it up and hands it to Catherine.
JONES
From Thomas.
Catherine gazes at it, puzzled. Jones scoops her belongings back into the purse and rises to her
feet, Catherine lowers the gun barrel.
JONES
I have a few things to tidy up, then I'll be leaving tonight.
(warmly)
Good luck, Mrs. Martell.
We HEAR her going as the SHOT CLOSES on the black gift box.

11.  HAYWARD HOUSE
Donna sits in the front room over a cup of coffee and a copy of the Gazette. The DOORBELL
sounds. At the door is a vaguely familiar man with a close light beard, spectacles and thick,
snowy eyebrows. We RECOGNIZE his face from the photograph in Earle's cabin.

Excuse me. I'm looking for Bill or Eileen Hayward.

I'm Donna.
(pause)
Would you like to come in, Dr. Craig?
CRAIG
I'd appreciate that.
They enter the living room, toward the perpendicularity of couch and chair.
DONNA
Would you like some coffee?
CRAIG
Thank you, no.
(sits, sees the Gazette)
Is this your local paper?
DONNA
Yes. It's a pretty small town.
Craig is stealing a glance at her, and various details of the room.

Now, don't you have two sisters?

You're in high school?
DONNA

CRAIG
I felt exactly the same way. High school's difficult; you
have no idea what you want to do with your life, so it
seems as if almost none of it applies to your life.
DONNA
(impressed)
That's right.
CRAIG
Trust me, it'll make sense later. For now, just enjoy it.
In all its absurdity.
Donna is visibly refreshed to hear so something from an adult that sounds so life-accurate.
CRAIG
I have a small gift for your dad. Can I trust you not to
open it?
DONNA
(intrigued)
Sure.
Craig pulls a small, wrapped box from his pocket.
CRAIG
Speaking of school. Will and I graduated thirty years
ago, this month. This is a small remembrance for him.
He hands it to her. With the box is a piece of paper.
CRAIG
(re the paper)
I should be on my way. That's the number where I'm
staying.

Hope to see you later, Donna.

whistle: we RECOGNIZE this as the piece Earle was playing on his Samurai flute.

12.  SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY
Encamped in one growing corner of the room is PETE MARTELL, surrounded by chess
boards, chess books, coffee, lined tablets on which he's made notations specific enough to
embarrass some field generals of actual wars. Cooper enters.
COOPER
Pete, how are we doing?
Martell looks up. Another face in need of sleep.
PETE
Never had to look at a chess board like it's a bunch of
actual human beings. Makes for some nasty dreams.
(beat)
I've been through every stalemate in recorded history, and
I've jerryrigged a few country standoffs they've written no
books about. But it's no use: there isn't a stalemate game
on earth where you don't lose at least a few footsoldiers.
(sighs)
The classic Herbstman leaves you with six pieces. Now I
can improve on that, but even if I get there in half the
time and keep twelve, that means six people will die.
COOPER
Do your best, Pete. Windom Earle's genius carries with it
the vice of impatientence. He doesn't want to kill eight
pawns. He wants royalty. Protect those, particularly the
queen, and we can frustrate him.
WOMAN (O.S.)
You can't do that.
PETE
(to Cooper)
My students.
In another corner of the room, LUCY and ANDY sit across a chess board, clearly at
loggerheads.
LUCY
Mr. Martell, Andy moved his knight but he didn't do the
little hook thing.
ANDY
You don't have to do the little hook thing. That's
optional.
PETE
Andy ... the knight has to do the little hook thing.

BLACKBOARD
Where Cooper has drawn this image on the board, beside the inverted triangles of Briggs:
LOG LADY (V.O.)
I was seven years old. I went walking up in the woods
and when I got back, I was told I'd disappeared for a
day. All I could recall was a flash of light ... and that
mark was on my leg.
BACK TO SCENE
BRIGGS
We all three recall the light.
LOG LADY
And also... the sound of an owl...
COOPER
I remember that.
LOG LADY
The only other other time I saw that sight and heard that
sound... was just before my husband died.
Cooper is staring at the board. He steps up to the square of four triangles and draws Briggs's
three smaller inverted triangles inside them creating another shape which immediately
excites Briggs and the Log Lady.
BRIGGS
I've seen that before.
LOG LADY
Yes...
Cooper turns to them excitedly.
COOPER
What is it?
Something about this figure is visibly upsetting to them both. Briggs looks at Cooper and just
shakes his head. The Log Lady hunkers down with her log, for security and insight, and finally
looks up, dismayed.
LOG LADY
I don't know...

15.  WOODS - DAY
OPEN ON a wooded vista, some hidden spot in the verdent forest. We HEAR a man's voice,
singing clear as a bell, 0 Bury Me Not On The Lone Prairie. CAMERA MOVES between the
pines to REVEAL Audrey and John Wheeler seated upon a blanket, a picnic lunch between
them, Wheeler singing his cowboy song. Audrey watches, jawdropped, she couldn't be more
surprised ... or taken with this handsome stranger. Wheeler finishes, peers at her. For once in her
life Audrey Horne is speechless. Finally:
AUDREY
Wow.
Wheeler says nothing, waits for her. Audrey, suddenly vulnerable, without the usual banter to
protect her, finally continues:
AUDREY
Nobody's ever sung a song to me before.
WHEELER
You must've been serenaded a time or two.
AUDREY (not coy)
I don't inspire a lot of singing. Most boys are afraid.
Wolf whistles, maybe.
WHEELER
(appreciating the revelation)
They don't know you then. Not really.
He's right. Audrey's been waiting a long time for someone to discover her secrets. She's
delighted, though not sure what to say. Wheeler interprets her silence as rebuke.
WHEELER
Sorry for being forward. It's not I like I know you that
well. In fact I don't know you at all.
(to self as well as Audrey)
Charm is a rocky road...
(quiet humor)
Another cowboy song, I know, a shot...?
AUDREY
(with an affectionate smile)
I'm completely tone deaf.
Now it's his turn to be discomfited. A beat. Both realizing that the other fills them with a
sort of uncertain warmth, the awkwardness that accompanies sudden infatuation, or love.
Wheeler reaches for a bottle of beer, changes the subject.

AUDREY
I don't think anyone really knows me.
WHEELER
That sounds like a warning.
AUDREY

I know.
WHEELER

Audrey. If there's some other guy, I'll...
AUDREY

A long beat. Audrey thinking about Cooper, first love, then, at last...
AUDREY (warm and certain)
No. There's not. There's nobody.
WHEELER
So what'll we do now?
AUDREY (with humor)
Know any more cowboy tricks?
WHEELER (in kind)
If you've got a lariat in that picnic basket, I could lasso
passing cattle.
AUDREY
The closest cow is miles from here.
WHEELER
Well. Stray dogs, raccoons, a bluebird ... anything you
want...

Donna nods assent. WE FOLLOW her out of the room and up the stairs. From far away, WE

Fearing this might again be the impostor, Donna starts down the stairs, but only gets a couple

you're going to understand this.
NADINE

Ed and Jacoby trade looks.
JACOBY
Well, yes, technically it is a breakup, Nadine...
ED
But it's a little more than that, too, honey.

Nadine stares at Jacoby. Her expression goes from incomprehension to discomfort to fear.

MAN

SHELLY
Oh, my boss was telling me I should enter this contest.

Miss Twin Peaks.
As she lowers his order, we see the EMERALD RING of Windom Earle.
MAN (EARLE)
You can kid about it, but you're very pretty. I think you
should enter.
SHELLY
Thank you. I never think of myself as pretty.
Shelly muses as she walks away. Over her shoulder we watch Cooper enter and take a counter
seat on the side opposite Earle, and further down. We CLOSE ON Cooper.
ANNIE (O.S.)
Are you ready to order?
He looks up at this unfamiliar voice and freezes on Annie Blackburne's face. There is instant,
mutual attraction. Something close to love at first sight. Cooper is hooked by Annie's soft
features - Botticcelli's Venus serving coffee. Annie feels it too, but is far less comfortable with
it.

every piece of furniture that's not nailed down and shot

HAWK
It's okay, Andy.
He is clearly frightened. Cooper and Hawk follow a trail of broken furniture. Truman sits in

COOPER

TRUMAN
Nice thing about the law. It doesn't breathe.

It didn't have to end like that... she didn't have to die...
The gun's aim swings into wider, more dangerous circles. Cooper steps in, pulls Truman into
a bearhug. Truman grabs onto him, finally allowing himself some comfort.

Lazare looks askance at this. Nadine simmers. Mike feels her iron grip tighten further.

25.  GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM
The Stop Ghostwood benefit has drawn a large, black tie crowd. BEN HORNE stands at the
microphone, located off on a wing of the newly constructed runway.
BEN
I'd first like to thank you all for this marvelous turnout.
It's gratifying to see so many people who are serious
about their environment.
(beat)
The Stop Ghostwood campaign is a determined effort to
keep the rabid development interests from trying to turn
our beautiful northwest forests into a monstrous
amusement park, destroying animal preserves that have
been undisturbed for centuries, the little worlds which
serve as sanctums for several endangered species.
Before moving along, I'd just like to remind us all that
ecology is not a luxury science, and it's not about pleasant
appearances: it's about survival. About whether we're all
going to make it. Period.
(beat)
But on the other hand, not to understate the value of visual
splendor, we come now to our fashion show. If you think
you recognize some of our models, it's because they're
concerned members of our community who have
graciously contributed their time tonight. So, ladies and
gentlemen, to kick things off, our host Richard
Tremayne.
Tremayne approaches the mike to scattered applause, grinning up past his eyebrows.
TREMAYNE
Thank you. Splendid gathering.
We DROP to a LONG SHOT of the runway, FAVORING the models as they emerge. The
first striding figure is Lucy Moran, cautiously eying Tremayne as she walks uncertainly out
along the ramp.
TREMAYNE
Our little Lucy wears a delightful mix of warm northern
comfort and southern insouciance. An elegant worsted
wool jacket over a sueded charmeuse T-shirt... fabulous,
isn't it?
Having nervously reached the end of the runway a little early, Lucy has to do a few too many
turns and starts to grow dizzy.
TREMAYNE
And a moonless-night-blue slim skirt of matching
worsted, for the look that always says, hey, world! I'm
here...

Lucy wobbles back toward the curtain. A pause. The next model, who looks more like he's
walking a plank than a runway, is Andy Brennan.
TREMAYNE
Mr. Brennan, a man for all seasons, is wearing a baby rib
wool turtleneck beneath a daring plaid all-wool
pendleton shirt.
Andy reaches the end of the ramp and freezes in stage fright, gawking out at the audience.
TREMAYNE
The look is completed by his black flaring cotton
trousers. For the man who wants to make a statement
while retaining the casual feel, whether he's out mastering
a task or riding the breeze of a chance meeting ...

That'll do it, Andy.
With stiff hulklike movements, Andy turns and goes.

Audrey hectically lines up the remaining models.
AUDREY
At this rate, were going to run late, so if you could all

Lucy walks past, still a little dazed, trailing Andy, the bright red turtleneck almost exploding
out of his shirt.

Ben, darling, let me ask you; who are you kidding with all this?
BEN
Catherine, I am absolutely one hundred per cent sincere.
CATHERINE
Ben, look who you're talking to. We're in the same line of
work: you've always been a little more obvious, but this...
at least I use some imagination.
BEN
Catherine, have you ever in your entire life had an
experience that truly changed you.
CATHERINE
Spare me the Born Again sales pitch and level with me,
you can't really hope to stop development plans with
this little sideshow; what do you actually expect to gain
from all this?
BEN
A first scrubbing on one of the dirtiest consciences in the
entire Northwest.
(beat)
It'll happen to you, Catherine. I know what you're
planning with Ghostwood. And granted, I used to see
life exactly the way you do. And no matter how many
deals I closed, or much money I made, inside I was a
black, miserable clod of dirt. Catherine, the one thing
that really affords you joy in life, the only authentic
thing is giving. Darling, don't wait until you're on your
death bed to find that out.
CATHERINE
God help you. It sounds like you actually mean this.

28. RUNWAY STAGE
Standing beside Tremayne, much to Richard's disgust, is Tim Pinkle, attired in a cherry
sportcoat and pink polyester pants. Beside Pinkle is a cage, containing a meek-looking weasel.
TREMAYNE
And now, to introduce us to an endangered little critter
whose home is currently under attack by the proposed
Ghostwooddevelopment project ... Mr. Tim Pinkle.
PINKLE
Thanks, Dick. How's everybody doing tonight?
(nothing)
That's good.
In following the taller Tremayne, Pinkle loosens the stand in order to lower the mike, which
drops with a loud thud down to his ankle. In trying to extend it back up, he encounters more
resistance, gives it a good yank and shoots the mike up for someone six-eleven. Tremayne just
stares at him. Finally Pinkle lowers it to where it was originally.
PINKLE
Thank you. I'm here to introduce you all to a little guy
who doesn't understand the dark peril that awaits him.
An innocent in a world gone mad ...
Tremayne lightly elbows him, in a plea for brevity. Pinkie drops down and opens the cage.
PINKLE
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you ... the endangered Pine
Weasel.
Pinkle reaches down into the cage and pulls up the frightened animal, who is half-hypnotized
by the lights.
PINKLE
This species, technically of the weasel family, not only is
nonaggressive toward us humans and has beautiful fur ... he
is also by nature an excellent controller of rodents.
Pinkle holds the animal up in front of Tremayne.

PINKLE

TREMAYNE
Must be my tie clasp.
PINKLE
And to various smells, particularly, believe it or not, very
cheap cologne ...
Ignoring this, Tremayne affectionately drops his head down toward the weasel, playing to the
audience. The little creature reaches up toward Tremayne.
PINKLE
Think he wants to give you a little kiss, Dick ...
TREMAYNE
(suppressing revulsion)
Hello there, little pilgrim.
The weasel lunges up sweetly and suddenly bites Tremayne on the nose. The host lets out a
yell, trying to pull himself away, but the animal won't let go. Tremayne finally wrenches
himself free, dancing up the runway in pain. The weasel screeches and bolts off the stage,
causing an immediate panic in the crowd. Women scurry around senselessly, screaming in fear.
PINKLE
No need to panic, folks ... he's completely harmless...
The place is in chaos. The weasel tears through the room, under a banquet table, spilling back
guests on both sides. Andy Brennan, still in costume, begins pursuit.
ANDY
Nobody panic!!......
Up on the stage, Audrey is out trying to restore order.
AUDREY
Please everyone, calm down... stay in your seats ...
From behind, an alarmed model knocks Audrey off the runway. She tumbles headlong ... into

They share a laugh as confused patrons knife by them. Audrey settles a little deeper into his

tightens the strangle line around his neck while she sits on top of him.
Jones bends over him and kisses him passionately. Truman uses this moment to flip her off
him. But at the same time Jones pulls the magnesium wire tighter. Truman fights to breathe
and free her hands from the garotte.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Truman manages to stand. Jones wraps her legs around him. Truman tears at her trying to get a
grip. Carrying her to a wall, Truman pounds her again and again against it. Jones is nearly
unconscious. Finally, her hands drop away from him. Truman keeps pounding, about to kill
her. Then stops himself. Looks down at the naked woman lying below him.

JOHN JUSTICE WHEELER pores over some books, maps, and in elaborate model for a
complicated irrigation system. A knock on the door.
FROM BEHIND THE DOOR
Room service.
WHEELER
It's open.
The door opens. Wheeler remains completely absorbed in what he is doing. Not noticing
that it is AUDREY HORNE who brings in his breakfast. Without looking up he retrieves a
money clip to give her a tip. Then notices it is Audrey. Surprised and pleased.

I trust your sleep was untroubled? Here at the Great

service very seriously -
Wheeler comes over to the bed, gently puts a finger to her lips to silence her.
WHEELER
Audrey ... did you know your grandfather?
(fingers still on her lips, becoming caress)
Colorful old guy, but the wisest man I've ever met. He
always used to say, "If you bring a hammer, you better
bring nails."
AUDREY (taking his fingers in hand)
What's that supposed to mean?
WHEELER
It means the next time you come into my room and sit
on my bed and carry on like this you had better be ready
to finish whatever it is you're trying to start.
AUDREY
Maybe I'm ready now.
WHEELER (simply)
Then be yourself.
AUDREY
This is myself.
WHEELER
You're a beautiful, intelligent, young woman. You don't
have to sneak in here and flirt like a high school girl.
Audrey fixes Wheeler with an challenging stare. Then:
AUDREY

"If you bring a hammer, you better bring nails."

you're always worrying, and I'm checking to see if you're
being yourself, but then you've got to keep an eye on you
too...
WHEELER
We'll be lucky if we can carry on a simple conversation.
AUDREY (her point exactly)
Yep.
WHEELER (beat, he moves closer)
Audrey, I have a plan. It involves a plane ride at sunset
and dinner for two.
AUDREY
What? When?
WHEELER
The sunset part or the dinner part?
AUDREY (she moves closer too)
I've got to go to the library, and my father wanted to
meet with me some time today -
WHEELER
If you're busy I'll understand...
AUDREY
Yes. I mean yes I'm busy. And yes I'll go.
They kiss.

Oh yeah.
COOPER
You think he needed a more rational reason? It's good

TRUMAN

Take me a day or so to get my sea legs.
COOPER
To be honest, Harry you look like hell. Maybe you
ought to recuperate at home.
TRUMAN
All I need's some coffee and maybe some food.
Cooper stops him.
COOPER
Sure cure for a hangover, Harry. You start with a nearly
frozen, unstrained glass of tomato juice. Drop a couple
of oysters in there and chug it down. Breathe deeply.
Next a heaping mound of sauteed sweetbreads with
chestnuts and Canadian bacon. Finally some biscuits and
a bucket of gravy, and here's where it gets tricky, you're
gonna need some anchovies -
Truman, growing green, stops him outside the men's room door.
TRUMAN
Excuse me.
Truman rushes into the bathroom. Cooper, having acheived the desired stomach-pump effect,
gives a thumbs-up.

DOC
Multi-trunk bonsai. The ultimate miniature.
A shakey Truman enters a moment later, Cooper hands him a glass.
COOPER
Bicarbonate of soda.
TRUMAN
Thanks. Where'd this come from?
Truman takes the card from the plant. Reads it. Grows even paler.
COOPER
It was delivered this morning.
TRUMAN
It's from Josie.
Truman sits down trying to hold onto his composure. To Cooper, Doc indicates the package that
Windom Earle left at his house, which Cooper has already seen. Cooper gets the message: involve
Harry. He urges Doc to speak.
DOC
Harry, Windom Earle was at my house.
TRUMAN
Windom Earle was?
DOC
He left this with Donna.
Truman takes out a chess piece that is tagged with a chess move. It reads "Kn to KB3."

Leo picks cards out of the deck. Earle flips the cards over. THREE QUEENS. On the faces
are pictures of DONNA, SHELLY, and AUDREY.
EARLE
Good. Now find the king.
Leo picks another card and flips it over. A king is there with Cooper's face glued on it.
EARLE
And now we need one more Queen.
Earle picks out a Queen without a face.
EARLE
The Queen of Hearts.
He picks up a brochure for the MISS TWIN PEAKS CONTEST.
EARLE
Miss Twin Peaks. What do you get if you win. A
dozen roses, a college scholarship, the accolades of your

fighting there. He reaches out to touch a piece when the door to his office OPENS. Truman,
still suffering from a world class hangover, turns to face Cooper as he enters.
TRUMAN
Pete just called in our next move.
Truman hands a piece of paper to Cooper. Cooper reads it, steps to the board, moves the
appropriate piece. He considers the resulting formation.
COOPER
We expose a pawn to his bishop.

TRUMAN
Want me to hold off?
COOPER
No. If he takes the pawn he'll forfeit the bishop and
most of his initial advantage. Feeling any better, Harry?
TRUMAN
Like someone pounded a railroad spike into my ear.
COOPER
Then a descent into a cool, subteranean cave may be just
what the doctor ordered.
Cooper tosses the helmet to Truman. He catches it cleanly.

22.  DOUBLER DINER - DAY
The diner is quiet, nearly empty. Annie cleans the counter, pauses to retrieve a flyer. It
reads: THE MISS TWIN PEAKS PAGEANT, our Twentieth Anniversary. Shelly steps into
view, reads it over Annie's shoulder.
SHELLY
Thinking of entering?
ANNIE
I think the real world's strange enough without getting up
on stage and parading around in a bathing suit and heels'
SHELLY
Guess they're not too big on that kind of stuff in the
convent.
ANNIE
That's a good guess.
SHELLY
Is it strange, you know, being back in civilization?
ANNIE

It wasn't as if they kept us locked up in the attic. We

NORMA
Okay. He's a few years older than you. Handsome, but
not too handsome. He's really, really smart. He's in the
FBI. He loves Twin Peaks. He loves pie and coffee.
And trees.
ANNIE

Good. Now I won't have to send to Washington for his

BEN
Audrey, when Jack Kennedy entered the White House, he
took his brother with him, because he trusted Bobby to
tell him the truth even when it wasn't pretty. When the
Bay of Pigs went up in smoke, Bobby was there. When

Bobby helped his brother shoulder through.

Ben, unaware, wraps his daughter in a big farewell hug.

Audrey takes one last look at Wheeler and walks out the door. A beat. And Ben slumps

WHEELER

BEN

25.  OWL CAVE - NIGHT
Two police vehicles parked in the dark, their lights shining brightly upon the rock formations
that enclose Owl Cave.

26.  OWL CAVE - NIGHT
START CLOSE on a pair of gloved hands desperately seeking purchase on a rocky wall.
Flashlight beams illuminate the scene. Encouraging voices are HEARD:
TRUMAN, COOPER, HAWK
That's it, Andy. Careful. One hand at a time.
CAMERA PULLS back to reveal Andy's head pressed against the wall, grimacing with effort,
and not a little afraid. He grunts, hand over hand, as Truman and the others shout instructions
from below. Then, finally, with one last moan ... Andy sinks out of frame like a stone.
Andy lands with a thud on the floor of Owl Cave. Flashlight beams criss-cross his features as
Cooper, Truman, and Hawk huddle about him
COOPER
Are you all right?
ANDY
(determined to be the man of action)
I'm fine.
They part, help Andy to his feet. And turn their lights on the interior of the cave. It is a large,
airy space filled with rocky outcroppings, strange shapes in the dark.
COOPER
Incredible.
As the beams of light trip across the cave walls, Hawk intones:
HAWK
We used to play here when I was a kid. Pretend it was
haunted by fierce ghosts.
Truman kicks something in the dark, picks it up. A beer can.

HAWK
This way.
Hawk swings his flashlight beam across the cave, illuminates the far wall. And a ROCKY
SHAPE upon it. Cooper and Truman aim their beams as well, step closer.
COOPER
Yes ...
The rocky symbol is a rough-hewn rendering of Cooper's drawing. An easily discernable shape
extruding from the cave wall. It does not appear to be man-made.
COOPER
(to self)
Two symbols combined into a larger whole. But for
what purpose?
TRUMAN
(the skeptic)
I don't know, Coop. It's similar, there's no denying that.
COOPER
It's more than similar, Harry. The tattoos are a
question. And this, somehow, is the answer.
Andy listens gravely, pick-axe over his shoulder, afraid. He flashes his light upon the symbol,
forces himself a little closer. As if determined to contribute despite his fears.
COOPER
Why do they call it Owl Cave?
SUDDENLY: an owl's SHRIEK to wake the dead, the FLAPPING of enormous wings,
something passes through the shadows overhead. Several things happen simultaneously:
Cooper, Hawk, and Truman whip their flashlights toward the passing sounds, but find nothing.
Andy yips, panics, and whirls about. His pick-axe STRIKING the cave symbol with a
mighty blow. Rocks chip and tumble, a sort of whooshing rumble is heard ... and a small
LANDSLIDE tumbles down upon his head.
TRUMAN
Andy!
All rush to his side, claw through the rocks and detritus. Andy lays beneath, bruised, stunned,
but essentially unharmed.

Coop?
Cooper isn't listening. He's shining his light on the cave wall, the section revealed by the slide.
His eyes are filled with wonder.
TRUMAN
What is it?
COOPER
I'm not sure.
Cooper steps forward, their beams join his to illuminate the wall. And there, partially
obscured by the rock that remains, is a CAVE PAINTING of startling color and design.
TRUMAN
Good God.
(reaching out to touch it)
It appears to be a hieroglyph. We'll need the proper
tools to excavate. Harry, I have no idea where this will
lead us. But I have a feeling, a definite feeling, it will
be a place both wonderful and strange.
Cooper reaches out to touch the mysterious design. HOLD ON the cave painting for a beat.

Cooper stops, looks off. He sees someone familiar in the dining room/bar.

29.  GREAT NORTHERN BAR - NIGHT
Annie Blackburne enters and sits alone at the bar, curious, uncertain. Will she ever be a part of

BARTENDER

The bartender steps off to fetch and pour. Annie turns her eyes back to the smokey room:
couples seated at tables, talking, intimate and close. Annie watches with fascination and
regret. A familiar VOICE penetrates her reverie. Agent Cooper.
COOPER
Hello, Annie.
ANNIE
Hi.
COOPER
Could I get you...
Annie notices the bartender has left her a cocktail.
ANNIE
No, thank you. I have rum and tonic.

I feel constantly amazed ... stunned. Music, people.
The way they laugh and talk. Some of them so clearly
in love. It's like a foreign language to me. I know just
enough of the words to realize how little I understand.
COOPER
I'd like to see the world through your eyes.
ANNIE
Why?
COOPER
There are things I would do differently if I had the
chance to start over again.
ANNIE
Me too.
Annie pauses, as if to consider a painful memory. She reaches for her glass of water, her sleeve
slips up, reveals scars on her wrist. Cooper sees it, says nothing. But Annie knows he saw them.
ANNIE
The thing is, I've failed before. I'm afraid I might fail
again.
COOPER
Do you want to talk about it?

COOPER
I don't expect anything.

Cooper smiles in kind, reaches out to touch Annie's hand and hold it, just below the scars. He's
wanted to touch her from the first moment they met.

Flashlight beams illuminate the scene. AGENT COOPER, SHERIFF TRUMAN,
DEPUTY HAWK and DEPUTY ANDY enter. Cooper and Truman carry flashlights,
backpacks filled with excavation equipment. Hawk holds a bright lantern. Andy is armed
with sketch pad, pencils. All pause, turn toward the cave symbol. Cooper reacts with a curse.
COOPER
Dammit.
The painting has been tampered with, ten dowels, with obscure symbols attached, now extend
from it, seemingly abstract, without obvious intent or meaning.
TRUMAN
But who...?
Hawk kneels at the base of the painting, casts lantern light upon the cave floor. He's examining
fresh tracks left in the dirt. Cooper steps toward him.
HAWK
I saw the same tracks outside the power station. Weight
shift to the left foot. A break in the heel.
COOPER
Windom Earle.
TRUMAN
What would Earle be doing here?
COOPER
That's a frightening question to contemplate.

Andy. I need an accurate, large scale rendering of this
painting. Harry, we need to speak to Major Briggs

Whatever you say, Coop. I'll call from the jeep.

2.  WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
START CLOSE on WINDOM EARLE. Seated in an armchair, pipe in hand, avuncular in
aspect, he begins:
EARLE
Once upon a time, there was a place of great goodness
called the White Lodge. Fawns gamboled there amidst
happy laughing spirits. The sounds of innocence and
laughter filled the air. When it rained it rained sweet
nectar that paralyzed the heart with the desire to live
one's life in truth and beauty.
(beat)
Generally speaking, a ghastly place reeking of virtue's
sour smell, engorged with the whispered prayers of
kneeling mothers, mewling newborns, and fools young
and old compelled to do good without reason. But, I
am pleased to note, our story does not end in this place
of saccharine excess.
As he speaks, CAMERA PANS from Earle, travels toward his unseen audience, revealing
LEO JOHNSON seated cross-legged on the floor, as if listening to a bedtime story.
EARLE
For there is another place, its opposite, of almost
unimaginable power, chock full of dark forces and
vicious secrets. No prayers dare penetrate this frightful
maw. Spirits there care not for good deeds and priestly
invocations. They are as like to rip the muscle from
our bones as greet you with a happy g'day. And, if
harnessed, these spirits, this hidden land of unmuffled
screams and broken hearts, will offer up a power so vast
that its bearer might reorder the earth itself to his liking.
(beat)
This place I speak of, is known as the Black Lodge. And
I intend to find it.
CAMERA CONTINUES to PAN, reveals a dull-witted YOUTH seated at Leo's school
desk. Long stringy hair, head band, a vacant stare. Some sullen refugee from a speed metal
talent show.
YOUTH
Listen, man. The story's cool. But you promised me
beer. Besides, you told me there was gonna be a party up
here. Black Lodge, White Lodge, like what's the big
deal?
CAMERA CONCLUDES its move, HOLDS ON Earle's computer screen, where we see a
computer rendering of the hieroglyph from Owl Cave.

The trick is to fit the pieces together just so...

10. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S OFFICE
Agent Cooper and Sheriff Truman confer in the latter's office. Truman examines the poem
fragment Shelly gave to Cooper.
TRUMAN
Mountains kiss... waves clasp... what's this all about,
Coop?
COOPER
It's part of a poem, torn into thirds. Sent to Shelly
Johnson, Audrey Horne, and Donna Hayward... by
Windom Earle.
TRUMAN
Earle's contacted all three? Are you sure?
COOPER
(quoting the poem from memory)
See the mountains kiss high Heaven
And the waves clasp one another;
No sister-flower would be forgiven
If it disdained its brother...
(beat)
I sent this same poem to Caroline once.
TRUMAN
I don't like the sound of this.
COOPER
It may be nothing more than a taunt. Earle takes a sick
pride in his ability to insinuate himself into innocent lives.
TRUMAN
And if it's not?
COOPER
Let's talk to the girls as soon as possible. See what they
recall.

desk. He peers at the poem for a beat, preoccupied, an idea forming. Hawk turns to exit.
COOPER

(off his look)
Bring me Leo Johnson's arrest report. Anything that
might have his handwriting on it.
Hawk, nods, exits. Truman wonders:
TRUMAN

COOPER

There isn't one. Yet.

11. CONFERENCE ROOM
Major Briggs watches Deputy Andy transcribe the cave painting with fascination. As Andy
connects two figures, the Major suddenly interrupts:
BRIGGS
Deputy Brennan? As I remember, the line you are
drawing should proceed downward, not across.
Andy checks the original rendering on his sketch pad. Andy erases, redraws. Then it hits him.
He turns to Major Briggs, mystified.
ANDY
How did you know that?
Cooper and Truman enter.
COOPER
Major Briggs. We need your help. Yet I find it
difficult to accurately describe why or how.
BRIGGS

COOPER
The Twin Peaks Sheriffs department is currently
involved in several disparate investigations. The
disappearance of a known felon, Leo Johnson. The
appearance of my former partner, a murderer, Windom
Earle. And the discovery of an ancient hieroglyph in a
place called Owl Cave.
(beat)
Logic demands that these investigations remain separate
entities. But recent developments suggest otherwise. I
believe that these mysteries are not separate entities, but
are in fact complimentary verses of the same song. I
cannot hear the song yet, Major Briggs. But I can feel it.
And that is enough for me to proceed.
BRIGGS
As a military man, I am familiar with damage done by
blind adherence to logic. How exactly may I help you?
COOPER
I need to know everything there is to know about
Windom Earle's work with Project Blue Book.
BRIGGS
That would involve accessing classified Air Force
computer files.
COOPER
Yes, it would.
BRIGGS
My security clearance was revoked shortly after my
disappearance.
COOPER
And your ability to access the Blue Book files?
BRIGGS
The issue is not one of access. There are, however,
certain moral judgements I must consider.
COOPER
Of course.
BRIGGS
Will this information help you to prevent future loss of
life?
COOPER
Yes.

BRIGGS
Is this a copy of the hieroglyph you found in Owl Cave?
COOPER
(joining Briggs)
Yes. Do you know it?
BRIGGS
I have dreamed it. Or seen it. Somewhere. Somehow.
Briggs stares at the hieroglyph for a long beat. Then turns to face Cooper and the rest.
BRIGGS
I will do what you ask.
Deputy Hawk enters with a file, hands it to Cooper.
HAWK
Leo Johnson's arrest report.
Cooper takes the file, opens it. He finds examples of Johnson's handwriting. As the others
look on, Cooper arrays the sample next to the poem fragments. As he works:
COOPER
The damage Leo suffered would no doubt alter certain
handwriting characteristics. But his basic style remains
the same...
(putting the pieces together, turning to the others)
This poem, sent by Windom Earle, was transcribed by
Leo Johnson.
TRUMAN
Leo's working for Earle?
COOPER
(looking back at poem)
Yes. Or is his captive.

evidence before them. Verses to the same song.

Leo carries the beer to the youth, now revealed INSIDE a huge papier mache CHESS PIECE.
YOUTH
Celebrate? I can barely move my arms.
Leo carefully puts the can to the youth's lips, offers a hearty swallow. Earle places the last few
pieces upon the wire frame, effectively encasing the heavy metal youth inside.

You don't.
Earle reaches into a chest, produces a wooden bow. He turns to Leo, orders.
EARLE
Leo. Fetch me an arrow.
Leo pauses - he's been feeding beer to the youth all along - turns to regard him.
YOUTH
Arrow. Whoa, man. I do not appreciate practical jokes.
EARLE
Leo. The arrow.
Leo sets the can of beer upon a table, faces Earle. And does not move. He manages:
LEO

Earle doesn't hesitate. He grabs the shock collar remote, presses the appropriate button. Leo
shivers and falls, struck down by its power.
YOUTH
Jeez, don't zap the geek. How'm I supposed to get my

Thank you, Leo.
Earle turns back to the papier mache chess piece, the youth trapped inside.
YOUTH
What's with the arrow, man... what are you doing?! This
isn't funny, man. This is not funny.
EARLE
Please. Be still.
YOUTH
What the hell are you doing...?!?
EARLE
(loading arrow as the youth continues to plead)
Think of all the hapless sinners, wondering where their
soul's destination lies? Think of the prayers and the
doubt, the gut-sucking fear that visits late at night. And
for what? To gain the answer to a simple question.
Where will my spirit wake? What life am I given after
my life? This grave question has plagued man's sorry
conscience for eons. And you, lucky boy, have the
answer... now.
Earle UNLEASHES the arrow, it tears through the air, pierces the heart of the papier mache
chess piece... and the heart of the heavy metal youth inside.
ANGLE ON CHESS PIECE
The arrow buried up to the hilt. A small trickle of blood seeping from the hole it makes.

Horne, Andy, Lucy, Lana Budding and a few of the models from the fashion show. Everyone
has two wine glasses in front of them and a spit bucket. On the table in front of Dick are a
number of wine bottles, covered in bags.
TREMAYNE
Good evening. Evening all. Welcome to our
oenophiliac soiree, another in a continuing series of
public events, sponsored by Horne Industries, to benefit
the Stop Ghostwood Development movement.
ANDY

Ono-what?
LUCY
(sotto)
Something to do with wine.
TREMAYNE
When my good friend, Ben Horne, asked me how would
I like to contribute to the Good Fight, I said to myself,
Dick, I said, you're a former sommelier why not try to
bring a little culture to the proceedings? I replied ... but
of course: a wine-tasting parry. Uplift the general level
of quality of life at the same time we're putting money
into the fight to save our trees. Voila!
(small, polite, smattering of applause)
I should of course mention that our wines this evening are
all courtesy of the Great Northern's wine cellar, thank
you, Ben, and now ... to the tasting! Lana, Lucy, if you'd
help me pour, please.
Lana and Lucy jump up to help him pour out the contents of the first tasting. Dick flirts rather
obviously with Lana, which Lucy can't fail to notice. She simmers as she pours.
TREMAYNE (CONTINUED)
(as they pour)
Our first wines tonight are reds. There are some schools
of thought who of course say there are no other wines but
reds.
Andy raises his hand.
TREMAYNE (CONTINUED)
Yes, Andy.
ANDY

There are also white wines and sparkling wines.

Don't pour quite so much, Lucy.
Another cold look from Lucy to Lana and Dick.
TREYMAYNE (CONTINUED)
Now that we're all poured, let's first examine -
(to Andy, who's drinking)
Don't taste it, yet, Andy, for heaven's sake.
Andy has a mouthful of wine.
TREMAYNE (CONTINUED)
Spit it out.
Andy spits into the bucket.
ANDY
Sorry.
TREMAYNE
That's all right. That's what we're here for: to learn.
Now, to the wine. First we must examine the nose of the
wine, to see what it can tell about its bouquet. And
we do that by ...
LANA
(the prize pupil)
By smelling.
TREMAYNE
Very good, Lana.
Another look from Lucy.
TREMAYNE (CONTINUED)
Lift the glass thusly ...
(lifting it to his nose, now talking into the glass)
And while vigorously rolling the wine around in the
glass, we breathe deeply and fully.
Unbeknownst to him, the wine seeps into the gauze bandage on Tremayne's nose and a crimson
blotch starts to creep cellularly upwards.

That's good. Now, procedurally, we take our first
taste, a big, boisterous gulp and roll it energetically
around our entire palate, trying to involve those hard to
reach taste buds, tucked away in the back of our tongues.
Remembering not to swallow ...
The class takes a sip and rolls it around in their mouths.
TREYMAYNE (CONTINUED)
Excellent. And now ... we ... spit.
As one, the group spits noisily into their buckets.

27.  BAR AREA - NIGHT
By the fireplace in the other room, Jack Wheeler enters and sits near a pensive Dale Cooper,
nursing a drink, staring into the fire. A beat. Wheeler emits a rueful sigh, thinking of Audrey.
A beat. Cooper allows a happy little whistle of satisfaction. He's thinking about Annie. A
beat. Wheeler sighs again. Cooper whistles. Both gradually aware of the other. Then, at last,
more to himself:
WHEELER
Love is hell.
COOPER
Sorry?
WHEELER
Love. It's hell.
COOPER
The Hindus say love is the ladder to heaven.
WHEELER
We're both right.
COOPER
"Proof of heaven, while we're living."
WHEELER
The Hindus have also been known to take a hike on hot
coals for recreational purposes.
COOPER

Self-discipline.

Self- discipline and love are a bad match.
COOPER

Earthly love.
WHEELER

COOPER
When you're in it, none.
WHEELER
It hits you like an eighteen-wheeler. And there's no
relief.
COOPER
It makes you feel more alive.
WHEELER
And you feel more of everything. Pain included.
COOPER
Pain especially.
WHEELER
Can't think of anything but her.
COOPER
No.
WHEELER
She goes away, it's like a part of you's ripped out of its
socket.
COOPER
(a look at him)
Sounds like you've got a pretty serious case.
WHEELER
I am roped, tied and branded.

COOPER

I feel like someone's taken a crowbar to my heart.
WHEELER
That's not bad.
COOPER
No. I think maybe it's been locked away long enough.
WHEELER
Then that's good.
COOPER
(lifts his drink)
Here's hoping.
WHEELER
Here's to you.
They drink. A beat. A VOICE interrupts:
VOICE
Mr. Wheeler, telegram for you, sir.
A BELLMAN holds out a telegram. Wheeler takes it, tips him. He opens the telegram. We
SEE it's from Brazil. Grim news.
WHEELER
Damn.
(to Bellman as he exits)
Bellman?
The Bellman stops, turns to regard him.
WHEELER
Tell the desk I'll be checking out. Thanks.
The Bellman exits. Wheeler collects his thoughts, rises.

The wine-tasting continues. Dick is hovering over Lana.
TREMAYNE
All right, class, what did that sip reveal to us? What
flavors are we enjoying?
LUCY
Tastes kind of woody.
TREMAYNE
No, not really. Anyone else? Lana?
LANA
Banana?

TREMAYNE
Correct, Andy, there is another acid, hydroxinine, which
is present in both flavors.
LUCY
Why don't we just skip the wine and have a banana split?
Registering, Lucy's mood, Dick pours more into Lana's glass, doting on her.
TREMAYNE
Let's have another sip, shall we, swallowing this time
and let's see what else we can discern.
LANA
Gosh, Dick, I never knew wine could have so many
different qualities.
TREMAYNE
Amazing, isn't it A really fine wine is like a
symphony. Strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion,
they're all present, playing in harmony.
Everyone sips. Dick turns to Lucy with a prefunctory tone.
TREMAYNE
And what reaction do you have Lucy?
She spits the wine out in his face.
LUCY
I'm pregnant. I'm not supposed to drink.
They look at each other.

30.  GAZEBO - NIGHT
Police cars. Cops. Lights trained on the gazebo, where a large box sits in the center. Cooper
drives up, is greeted by Truman. They move towards the gazebo.
TRUMAN
We thought at first it might be a bomb. We don't
exactly have a bomb squad. It's weird.
COOPER
What did you do?
TRUMAN
Andy brought his metal detector. If it is a bomb it's
not metallic and there's no ticking sound, so...
(stopping Cooper)
Be careful, Coop, I think it is meant for you.
COOPER
I doubt it Harry. Windom is too precise. This will
have to do with some other itinerary on his peculiar
journey. When he tries to kill me it will be face to face
and far removed from chicanery or subtrafuge.
Cooper moves confidently up to the gazebo. Finds a small rope emerging from the top, with
a ring attached and a sign that reads, 'Pull Me."
COOPER
Let's see what he's up to.
He pull the ring. A moment later all four sides of the box begin to fall to the ground.
TRUMAN
(to the group)
Get back!
Cooper doesn't move as the box falls apart. Revealed inside is a large black, papier-mache
chess piece, a pawn. Sticking out of the top is the very dead head of Windom Earle's victim.
A sign on the pawn reads, "NEXT TIME. IT WILL BE SOMEONE YOU KNOW."

Bobby and Shelly sit in a diner booth. Shelly holds a crumpled copy of her pageant speech.
SHELLY

"...and that's the only way we're ever going to save the
trees. It's time to stand up and kick some butt for our
environment. Before it's too late for all of us."

That's beautiful, baby. Letter perfect.
BOBBY

I'm not so sure about the "kicking butt" part. How 'bout

tell if it is day or night. At one end is the blackboard with a drawing of the cave painting. A
MOVE down the table reveals computers, more paraphanalia. Piles of charts, library books,
plus attempts to duplicate the dowels that shot out of the cave wall.
MAJOR BRIGGS, who looks like he's been up all night, guides Bookhouse Boy CAPPY
through a reference book while pointing at the drawing.
BRIGGS
See if any of these symbols have to do with harvest
schedules or ancient calendars. Look for any curious
nomenclature.
CAPPY
Got it, Chief.
Cappy gets to work. Cooper and Truman enter, exchange greetings.
COOPER
Garland, you're exhausted.
Briggs gestures toward a small box atop his desk filled with files, notebooks, a videotape.
BRIGGS
I spent the night obtaining and perusing the Project Blue
Book files regarding Windom Earle. I found it
impossible to sleep after.
COOPER
What did you learn?
BRIGGS
Windom Earle was the best and brightest among us. But
when our attention turned from outer space to the
wooded areas surrounding Twin Peaks, he became
destructively obsessive. Earle acted in an overzealous
and secretive manner. Possessive of his assignments.
And finally, violent. He was removed from the project.
Briggs reaches into the box, removes the video tape, inserts it into a VCR.
BRIGGS
I found this in the Project archives.
Briggs turns on recorder and monitor. A beat. GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE footage
appears on the screen. Slightly out of focus, as if gleaned from a surveillance camera.
WINDOM EARLE, younger, wearing a white lab coat, faces an unseen interrogater. He
speaks with quiet contempt:

EARLE ON SCREEN
(in mid-oration)
... these evil sorcerers, dugpas, they call them, cultivate
evil for the sake of evil and nothing else. They express
themselves in darkness for darkness, without leavening
motive. This ardent purity has allowed them to access a
secret place of great power, where the cultivation of evil
proceeds in exponential fashion. And with it, the
furtherance of evil's resulting power. These are not fairy
tales, or myths. This place of power is tangible, and as
such, can be found, entered, and perhaps, utilized in some
fashion. The dugpas have many names for it, but chief
among them is the Black Lodge.
(beat)
But you don't believe me, do you? You think I'm mad.
Overworked. Go away.
Earle turns from the unseen camera. The screen goes BLACK. Cooper presses rewind, means
to view the tape in its entirety. We SEE Earle's, in black and white, image in reverse. Cooper
speaks OVER, shares his thought as he forms them.
COOPER
When Windom Earle returned, I assumed he had come
for vengeance. For me. But I miscalculated. Windom
has insinuated himself into the lives of those I care for.
He has murdered innocents. He has engaged us in
subterfuge and red herring. But those acts were merely
camouflage. Windom Earle is after something else.
The Black Lodge.
(re Earle on monitor screen)
What I want to know is, what does that, the Black
Lodge, have to do...
(re the blackboard hieroglyph)
...with this?
TRUMAN
You think there's a connection?
COOPER
Windom does.
(beat)
Harry, let's divide up Earle's files, check them top to
bottom. Cappy, find out everything you can about the
evil sorcerers known as dugpas. Garland, maybe you
should get some sleep.
BRIGGS

to clear my head.

WINDOM EARLE, earphone in place, listens and laughs. LEO JOHNSON stands next to
him.
EARLE
You know, Leo, the only thing Columbus discovered was
that he was lost. Cooper and the gang aren't even off the
snide, yet.
(studies the hieroglyph, in a sing song voice)
I know something they don't know.
(serious)
I know something Young Dale merely suspects.
MOVE BACK to see Earle has set up his own war room/command module. Bur Earle's work
seems more advanced and he has more equipment. The familiar chess board remains.
EARLE
Project Blue Book. Little men - pee wits loaded with
optimism. They were a deterrent so slight it was
practically encouragement.
Earle refers to his copy of the hieroglyph, means to transfer the image to his computer screen.
EARLE
Yet, I would like to ask Major Briggs a question or
three. Polish up that bald nub of his and see what shines.
Perhaps, Leo, we too should venture out for a good
stretch.
Earle brings the copy closer, compares it with his computer mockup. The chess board is in the
way. Earle sweeps it off the table. He is too absorbed in his work to notice Leo take the
CONTROL for the shock collar off the table and slide it into his pocket.

DONNA HAYWARD sits on the floor of the attic. Frustrated. She has been through a lot of

BIRTH CERTIFICATE that reads:

"Female Child. Mother, Eileen Hayward. Daughter
Donna Marie."
The name of the father has been left blank. Donna opens the scrapbook. She pores through the
pictures coming upon a photograph of her parents at a costume party, dressed as hoboes. The
theme of the party is written on an arch in the picture. It says, "Better Days." Donna whips
through more of the pictures till she comes upon one that stops her. Eileen and Doc smile out
at her from some long ago party. In between them is a smiling Ben Horne, his arms about Doc
and Eileen.. Then there is a photo of Ben and Eileen together. Ben grinning at the camera.
Eileen grinning at Ben. Donna stares at the picture until she is startled by her Mother's voice
from below.
EILEEN'S VOICE

Donna scrambles to put the bonds and the birth certificate back into the scrapbook.

sorcerers bent on evil. Rather like the Kali worshippers
of India. Another fine bunch of zanies, let me tell you.
Blood for breakfast, blood for lunch ... those were the
good old days.
Earle looks up, sees Leo standing before the three playing card Queens attached to the bulletin
board. Audrey, Donna, and Shelly. Leo turns to Earle, disturbed, confused.
EARLE
Do my anecdotes bore you?
LEO
Sh...sh ... Shelly.
EARLE
Yes. Very good, Leo. You remember.
LEO
Sh ... Shelly.
EARLE
Tawdry little trollop. Just between you and me, old
boy, your wife has some fairly modern views on marital
fidelity. No matter, she is still fit for a Queen. Would
you mourn her passing, Leo? I doubt it.
Leo stares at the picture of Shelly, then back to Earle. Uncertain, confused. Earle clarifies:
EARLE
Her death, Leo. Shelly's imminent demise. It's really
very simple. Shelly wins Miss Twin Peaks. Shelly
dies. Maybe you'd like to help.
LEO
Shelly. NO.
Leo understands. He means to save her. Leo reveals the shock collar control, waves it at Earle
is if the control, not the collar, delivered the painful shocks. Earle spies it, reacts with mock fear.

Confused and frightened, Leo continues to pump on the control and continues to shock himself.
Finally, Earle takes the control from his helpless hand.
EARLE
Poor, Leo. We are all love's fools, more or less.

9.  GREAT NORTHERN - DAY
DOC HAYWARD finishes giving BEN HORNE a physical. Doc is purring his stethoscope
away and Ben is buttoning up his shirt. Both are tense.
BEN
The insurance company's sent me so many forms I could
get a heart attack lifting them.
DOC
You're fine. It's what in your heart that you should
worry about.
BEN
I know you have reason to doubt me. But I am only
interested in doing the right thing. For the good of
everybody.
Doc takes a long look at Ben. He believes him.
DOC
Then stay away from Eileen.
BEN
I can't. Not as long as the lie survives.
DOC
Dammit, Ben. It isn't that simple. I believe you. I
applaud your desire to do the right thing. But goodness
in you is like a timebomb. And there's nothing good
about ruined lives.

Wheeler sticks his head in the door as he knocks.
BEN

Jack! Come in. You know Will Hayward.
Wheeler is obviously upset. For the first time unsure. He tries to be polite.
WHEELER
I met your daughter the other day. Beautiful girl.
DOC
I think I should get back to the office. Nice to see you,
John. Ben, be careful please.
Doc goes out. Ben motions to the chair in front of the desk but Wheeler is in too much of a
hurry.
WHEELER
Ben, I've been trying to find Audrey.
BEN
She should be back any minute.
WHEELER
(blurting it out)
I've got to go, Ben. They're gassing up the jet as we
speak.
BEN
Well, give her a call when you get to wherever it is you're
in such a hurry to get to.
WHEELER
Ben, a friend of mine, well, more than a friend, a partner,
was murdered last night.
Ben reacts with evident concern. Wheeler takes a chair and tries to relax.

Audrey moves through the lobby, tired but excited from her trip to Seattle. The clerk behind
the desk sees Audrey.
CLERK
Ms. Horne. I have several messages...
Just then: Deputy Hawk appears, intercepts.
HAWK
Audrey. Agent Cooper would like to see you at the
Sheriff's station.
AUDREY
Oh. Well, I have a lot of work to do, but maybe this
afternoon
HAWK
Now. It's important.
Audrey pauses to wonder. Then walks with Deputy Hawk toward the door.

11.  BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY
Wheeler explains his problem. Ben is panicked. Both seated on the office steps.
WHEELER
Ben, I have to leave.
BEN
Of course, of course.

But what about Stop Ghostwood? How do I get a hold
of you? I need more time.
WHEELER
A brave man is dead. My friend. And now I have to
take his place.
BEN

You're not coming back. Damn this rain forest business

BEN
Strive for goodness. Tell the hardest truth first.
WHEELER
Do the best you can. That's all any of us can do.
Ben sighs, offers his hand. They shake and then hug. Then get to their feet.
BEN
Goodbye, John. I'm sorry Audrey wasn't here.
WHEELER

Giver her this. Tell her I...
BEN
(taking letter)
Good luck. Come home soon.
Ben watches Wheeler walk out the door.

12.  WOODS - DAY
Briggs walks through the woods, dog tired but enjoying the solitude and nature. He stops to
inspect a particularly beautiful Douglas Fir. He runs his hands up and down the bark trying to
remember something. He fingers the tattoo behind his head. From behind him he hears
singing. He turns to see a COSTUME HORSE strolling down the path towards him. He
stares at it, stunned. The horse stops singing. Looks it Briggs.
HORSE
Hello, Wilbur.
A hand comes out from under the costume and a dart/tranquilizer whizzes out hitting Briggs
who wobbles away from the horse. He makes it about ten feet then topples over. The horse
stands over the downed pilot. Briggs desperately tries to focus on the horse head as it bends
over him.
BRIGGS

OPEN ON the three pieces of paper forming the poem. Cooper is placing them together.
Shelly, Audrey, and Donna sit across from him.
COOPER
Each of you received a part of this poem. And each in a
curious manner. Along with an invitation.
AUDREY
We all went to the Roadhouse but nobody showed up.
COOPER
In the past few days have any of you had contact with a
stranger? Someone that sticks out as peculiar or
charming or just plain puzzling.
DONNA
(after a beat)
Well, there was that weird guy that claimed he was a
friend of Dad's.
SHELLY
The same day I got my poem I got a ten dollar tip for a
cup of coffee. That was pretty peculiar.
AUDREY
And there was a funny old guy at the library. He asked
me to read it to him.

15.  BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
START CLOSE on the mysterious black box, now open, sent to Catherine Martell.
CAMERA PANS, reveals the slightly smaller box found inside. Unlike the original, this
box has a finely filigreed lid, the twelve signs of the zodiac inscribed on its surface. A
HAND enters frame, pushes the zodiac signs. The filigreed squares give slightly, suggesting
that the correct combination will open it.
CATHERINE'S VOICE
(over latter)
His servant woman, what's her-name, Jones, delivered it
shortly after he died.
ANDREW
Eckhardt's last request. A clever jape, perhaps. Or
something of value..?
(seeking a way to open)
Try the hammer.
CATHERINE MARTELL and ANDREW PACKARD hover over the boxes. Catherine
ignores Andrew, presses the zodiac signs with increasing frustration.
CATHERINE
Won't work. There's a secret to opening each box, and
this one...
(exasperated, shoving the box away)
... is about to drive me mad.
Catherine pauses, seems about to hurl it through the nearest window. She turns to her brother.
CATHERINE
Tell me some good news, Andrew. Anything.
ANDREW
(fascinated by the black box)
Our foreign investors are chomping at the bit, from Paris
to Beijing. You'll get your golf course, Catherine. Right
next to the Great Northern Hotel.
CATHERINE
Ben's doing everything he can to stop us.

ANDREW
He's too late. When the project was still in his
possession, Ben cleared every possible hurdle. Zoning,
impact statements. He was, and is, his own worst
enemy.
Andrew's focus shifts palpably to the mysterious box. He pushes the zodiac buttons, tries
different combinations.
CATHERINE
As always. What...?
ANDREW
Nothing, dear. Just trying a few simple combinations
CATHERINE
Let me.
Catherine tries to get at the second box, but Andrew will not give way. The mysterious gift
inspires a possessive mania in both.
ANDREW
One minute, Catherine. Eckhardt's birthday, my
birthday, I know, the date the gift arrived...
(the box springs open)
CATHERINE
Give it to me.
(grabs the box, peers inside)
Not again.
She withdraws a third black box, a little smaller than the last. Andrew doesn't hesitate:
ANDREW
I opened it.
Andrew snatches the third box. And, before Catherine can intercede, sets it upon the table,
grabs the hammer, and strikes it as hard as he can. The box splinters, opens. Catherine shoves
Andrew aside, reaches into it...
CATHERINE
(hopes dashed yet again)
Oh, Andrew...
... And pulls out a fourth and final box. Small and slender, stainless steel. As mysterious as
the rest. Catherine and Andrew pause to gaze at it, wonder what secrets are harbored inside.

16.  EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
The sun makes its way through the cabin's window.
EARLE'S VOICE
When did you first see the symbol in Owl Cave?
An ARROW flies through the air, sticks deep into a brightly colored target. And just inches
from Major Briggs, bound upon it. Windom Earle stands at a near distance, holds out his free
hand for another arrow. Leo, subdued by his recent beating, complies. But when Earle turns
back to Briggs, Leo's eyes follow him with newfound mental vigor. He's beginning to reclaim
his senses.
BRIGGS
(brave to the last)
I am not at liberty to divulge that information.
EARLE
(playful, insane)
Cheater.
Earle lets fly another arrow, pinning Briggs right trouser leg to the target. And, judging by
the spot of blood that appears, piercing some part of his flesh as well.
EARLE
What does the cave painting mean?
BRIGGS
I am not at liberty to divulge that information.
EARLE
Damn, but I love the military mind!
Earle fires another arrow, this one strikes the target just inches from Briggs' ear.
EARLE
(with fervor equal to the previous questions)
What's the capital of North Carolina?
BRIGGS
Raleigh.
Earle extracts an ampule of amber liquid from his jacket, then a syringe. He draws the liquid
into it.

Major, I admire your fortitude. Had I the time and the
patience, we might continue this game indefinitely.
However...
Earle jabs the syringe into Briggs' chest with sudden violence.
EARLE
...I have neither.
(turning back to Leo)
Catch.
Earle tosses the empty syringe at Leo. Leo dodges it. Earle turns back to Briggs. The drug
takes hold quickly. Briggs struggles deep within a narcotic haze. Earle whispers, he means to
test the drug's effect.
EARLE
Your name, please.
BRIGGS
Garland... Briggs.
EARLE
Garland, what do you fear most in the world?
BRIGGS
The possibility that love is not enough.
EARLE
Garland, please. I shall weep. How much does your
wife weigh?
BRIGGS
One hundred and fifteen pounds.
EARLE
Good for her. Now, when did you first see the
hieroglyph in Owl Cave?
BRIGGS
In...in dreams.
EARLE
What kind of dream?
BRIGGS
I went night-fishing with Agent Cooper. There was a
bright light, the guardian beyond it. I was taken, but my
mind...still I recognize the signs...

A tremor ripples through Briggs. He begins to babble.
BRIGGS
Taht mug uoy ekil si gnimoc kcab ni elyts... Taht mug

EARLE
Oh, Garland. I was hoping for a lengthy conversation.
(turning away)
Leo. Put the Major to bed. I'm afraid his mind has
begun to wander.
Leo steps to the target, removes the ropes that bind Briggs to it. Earle pauses to remember the
last words he told him.
EARLE
There is a time... if Jupiter and Saturn meet...
Earle ponders as he repeats with delight.

17.  HURLEY HOUSE - DAY
START ON a standing screen in the dark living room of the Hurley house. Slides projected
upon it. Just now: Nadine in wrestling garb, slamming some hapless opponent to the mat.
NADINE'S VOICE
...and this is me with last year's regional champion from
Yakima. He was cute. But a little slow. Next!
The slide changes. Nadine now appears atop a dazed opponent, a referee counts beside them,
about to slam his hand on the mat to signal "pin".
ANOTHER ANGLE
NADINE stands, peers proudly at the screen. MIKE, ED, and Norma are arrayed on the
couch behind her. All equally uncomfortable, but determined to play along. DR. JACOBY

One last slide. Nadine with an armful of trophies.
NADINE
And this is me with all the stuff I won.
Nadine turns to the couch, beams, curtsies. Ed leads the others in polite applause.
NORMA
Congratulations, Nadine.
MIKE

Way to go, babe!
Nadine leaps upon couch next to Mike, gives him a big kiss. She takes his hand, holds it
close to her breast. Jacoby turns on the lights, addresses the he resulting foursome.
JACOBY
(to all, but to Nadine in particular)
Thank you, Nadine. You're probably wondering why
we're gathered here today. I have found that when a
couple contemplates divor -
(catches himself)
- er, breaking up, it is sometimes. easier to talk about
our feelings in the company of others. Nadine, maybe
you would like to begin.
NADINE
Okay. Uhm. I guess it all started when I noticed
Mike's buns in the hall at school.
JACOBY
And...how are you feeling now?
NADINE
(toying with Mike's hand as she speaks)
Well. A little guilty, I guess. I mean because I'm so
happy and I worry about Ed being sad.
JACOBY
Ed, are you sad?

JACOBY
Nadine. How does that make you feel?
NADINE
It makes me feel like maybe it's time for us to get on
with our lives the best way we know how. And leave the
past behind us.
It's a startlingly clear-headed pronouncement. Nadine gives Mike's hand a brief, affirming
kiss. Jacoby nods approval. He turns to Ed, prods:
JACOBY
Ed? Do you have something you would like to tell
Nadine?
ED
(clears throat, takes the plunge)
Nadine. Norma and I are planning to get married.
A beat. All regard Nadine. Wait for her reaction. Finally:
NADINE
Really? That's wonderful, Eddie. 'Cause Mike and me
are getting married too.
That's news to Mike. Nadine squeezes his hand with superhuman strength. Mike's mouth opens
in a silent scream. Then he flat out HOWLS.

AUDREY
I got back this morning. But Agent Cooper wanted to

BEN

Is anything wrong?
AUDREY
Some creep sent me a poem. Daddy, have you seen
Jack? I called his room but nobody answered.
BEN
While you were away, I had the most incredible
brainstorm.
AUDREY

The Stop Ghostwood movement needs a spokesperson,
someone with a highly visible profile to inspire our
community to action.
AUDREY
Daddy, where's Jack -?
BEN
(man on a mission)
You can do it, Audrey. As Miss Twin Peaks you can
become that spokesperson, you can use your public

VOICE
Straight... hold... steady... stop.
The taxi jerks to a stop in front of the jet. A piece of luggage falls to the runway, followed by
Wheeler, who pulls himself to safety from the back seat where TIM PINKLE sits. His blind
brother, TOM, sits behind the wheel in the front seat. Wheeler stares at the blind man. Tim
explains his brother.
TIM
He loves to stuff, and he loves to drive. Otherwise he

Well, I am very glad to have the opportunity to be
thankful for arriving here.
TIM

My symptoms suggest the onset of malaria. Yet I've

Cooper stands amidst the dancing couples. He gestures for Annie to join him there. Annie
demurs. But Cooper insists. He won't budge. Finally, Annie smiles, slides off the barstool,

The microphone SQUEALS, a little puff of smoke drifts past the Mayor's nose. He looks

MILFORD
Damnation. Is this on...? Hello...?
The microphone is dead. A STAGEHAND scuttles into view, attempts to replace it.
Meanwhile, Annie quietly confesses, eyes straight ahead:
ANNIE
What I mean is, I understand why you treat me with
care. Why you hesitate. The convent evokes images of
helpless women fearful at the thought of emotions other
than those derived from scripture and prayer.
(choosing her words carefully)
But when you hold me, when we kiss, I feel safe and
eager. I'm not afraid. Not of anything you make me

screen, a series of maps, open books before him. The books are astrological in nature, various
charts and planetary configurations. Just now: Earle completes his computer rendering of the
Owl Cave hieroglyph.
EARLE
(giddy incantation)
If Jupiter and Saturn meet, oh what a crop of mummy
wheat...
Leo watches Earle closely. He seems more alert with each passing moment. And sympathetic
to the Major's plight. Earle addresses him, teacher to pupil, gesturing to the hieroglyph.
EARLE
The planets that our babbling Major spoke of, are more
than distant orbs. They are, in fact, a clock. A clock
that tells a time. And the time...?
Earle looks to Leo for the correct response. Leo says nothing.
EARLE
The time draws nearer with each ticking tock. Dale
wasn't far wrong, the cave painting is an invitation of
sorts, telling us when the revels begin. But what Dale
doesn't know, is where to find it.
Earle's fingers dance across the computer keyboard. Calling up two squares upon the screen.
The hieroglyph. And a map of Twin Peaks.

EARLE
For you see, the cave painting is not only an invitation...
Earle taps instructions, watches as the two squares move closer upon the computer screen until
superimposed atop each other.
EARLE
...it is also, a map. A map to the Black Lodge.
CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN. It's a perfect match. A beat. And the two images
begin to vibrate, almost imperceptibly. Earle leans closer. Music up. The images vibrate
faster and faster, the superimposition has unleashed dark magic. Earle smiles, delighted.
Begins to LAUGH. Leo holds his hands to his ears, pained by sound only he can hear. The
vibrations reach a fever pitch and... the computer SPUTTERS and goes BLACK. CAMERA
MOVES RAPIDLY TOWARDS THE DARK SCREEN...

32.  MONTAGE/ WOODS - NIGHT
Suddenly: a series of IMAGES, fast-paced, accompanied by the appropriate music, the
sounds of owls, raging wind.
JOSIE screams, trapped within the drawer pull.
CAMERA POV races madly through the woods, headed toward the Black Lodge.
Then, in an instant, quite jarringly - SILENCE, a grove of trees, the air still and calm. An
eerie beat. An ARM coalesces in midair, inch by inch, now reaches about testing the cool
night, fingers prodding. The wind begins to rise. Satisfied, the arm recedes, disappears.
A beat. BOB'S disembodied HEAD follows. Fierce winds blow, shaking the trees with
mighty force. Bob's floating head peers about, now snaps back into a feral HOWL. Then Bob
VANISHES in a BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT.
The winds recede. All is calm again. Save for the patch of SCORCHED earth below.

ACT ONE
FADE IN:
1.  WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN - DAY
LEO JOHNSON and MAJOR BRIGGS sit captive against a wall. Leo slowly looks around
the room. Does so again. Apparently satisfied , he rises to his feet and moves until the ankle
chain snaps him to a halt. Straining forward, he is able to lean over a table, and takes
something from its drawer. He then returns to beside Briggs, who still looks very dazed,
unconscious of his surroundings. Leo, with great effort, fits his new possession into the lock of
Briggs's handcuffs. Briggs is released. But doesn't realize it. Leo shakes him.
LEO
Save Shelly ...
Leo is looking up at the wall with Shelly's photo. Enough internal fog clears for Briggs to
realize he is now free. He gets up unsteadily and stumbles away. CLOSE ON the wall
photos.
MATCH 
2. SAME PHOTOS - LATER
SOUND of a door closing. Footsteps. EXPAND TO show WINDOM EARLE coming in
to see Briggs is gone.
EARLE
Why, who in the world let Major Briggs loose, Leo? It
couldn't have been you, could it?
Leo cringes, expecting another shock. None comes.
EARLE
No, no punishment little Leo. It's to late for that to
do us any harm. And I have a new game for you.
He holds up a burlap bag. Something's moving inside.

3.  DINER - DAY
Over by the kitchen, SHELLY and ANNIE are sorting silverware, when they're joined by
NORMA, who carries over a tray of freshly baked pies.
NORMA
Here's our contribution to the Miss Twin Peaks Gala
Buffet. And I fully expect to see one of you up there
tonight in the winner's circle.

ANNIE

NORMA
A day of healing and coming together.
SHELLY
We could use more than a day.
(pause, then)
Norma, is it true they're going to honor you tonight?
Twentieth anniversary of when you won?
NORMA
(playful)
Hush.
SHELLY
If you entered you could win today.
NORMA
Listen to her, working on the judge already.
SHELLY
Since you brought it up ...
ANNIE
Good question: who are you going to vote for?
Ahelly and Annie put an arm around each other and present a united front.
ANNIE
Maybe they'll let you split your vote.
NORMA
(laughing)
We have a customer.
ANGLE ON DALE COOPER entering the diner. It's clear whose customer he is: to
Shelly's intrigued glance, Annie walks over toward the counter.
COOPER
Looks like a staff meeting of the Double R brain trust.
ANNIE
We're trying to decide who's going to win tonight.

I think you're not as objective as you think you are.
COOPER
Perhaps that's why it seems so important to me that we
kiss.
ANNIE
(affectionate, not shy)
You impetuous boy. We have an audience.
COOPER
I know this violates multiple laws of physics, but at his
moment, Annie, and I mean this quite literally... you are
the only person in the room.
Annie beams. They lean across the counter to kiss. Shelly and Norma look on, smile, look
away.

4.  GREAT NORTHERN - DAY
AUDREY HORNE stands pensively, her face half-lit by the fireplace glow. BEN HORNE
enters, arms filled with books they nearly obscure him. Audrey manages a smile.
AUDREY
Hi, Daddy.
BEN
(pausing by the fire, nearly losing hold of a
tome)
Audrey. The most intelligent face I've seen all day. You
make the rest of us look like primates.
AUDREY

BEN
(listing each and every one)
The Koran, the Bhagavad-Gita, the Talmud, the Bible,
New and Old Testaments, the Tao-te-ching ... I have in
my arms those holy books that constitute the fundamental
framework of man's philosophies of good. Somewhere in
here are the answers I seek. I intend to read them, cover
to cover until find ...
Audrey's attention has wandered back to the fire. Ben Finally stops rambling, sees the sad
expression on her face.
BEN
Listen to me, prattling on. It's Jack, isn't it?
AUDREY
He's only been gone a day. I ask myself how much will it
hurt next week?
BEN
Let me give you a piece of ageless wisdom culled from
these volumes: time heals all wounds.
(she starts to reply)
I know what it feels like. Believe me, I know. He'll be
back.
AUDREY
We barely had time to realize how we felt ...
BEN
But what you had was highly concentrated.
AUDREY
It's the concentrate they make concentrate from.
(sigh)
I'm afraid I'll never see him again.
BEN
Jack's a man of his word. If he said he'll be back, he'll be
back, I promise you.
AUDREY
(moved)
You can't promise. But thanks for wanting to. I actually
came in here to update you on my Seattle trip.
BEN

Update away.

AUDREY
(slowly turning her mind to business)
The Packards are using Twin Peaks Savings and Loan to
funnel cash for the Ghostwood Project, but the bank's
keeping a very low profile. They don't want the bad
publicity.
BEN
Bad publicity is exactly what they're going to get.
Audrey, have you given any more thought to the Miss
Twin Peaks pageant?
AUDREY
Daddy, from the bottom of my heart, I don't want to be
the town bathing beauty.
BEN
Audrey, Miss Twin Peaks is the ultimate local forum. It
would be truly inspirational to have a winner with a
political sensibility that extends beyond makeup
strategies and recipes for cherry pie.
(the Horne twinkle)
And as you know, each contestant makes a speech to the
asembled town. This year's theme concerns our
immediate environment. And what we must do to
preserve it.
HOLD ON Audrey for a beat. Considering brand new strategies.
AUDREY
Maybe I'd better take a look through those books myself.

5.  SHERIFF'S STATION - CONFERENCE ROOM
START ON the cave painting reproduced on the blackboard: a cluttered concentration of
various symbols, stick figures, stars, hieroglyphs. PULL BACK to ANDY BRENNAN
standing myopically close to this drawing, staring at it with his own personal brand of awe.
Cooper and TRUMAN, looking sleepless, re-enter the room carrying their coffees.
COOPER
Has he taken his eyes off it yet?
TRUMAN
Not today.

We've still got people out combing the forest for Major
Briggs.

COOPER
Harry, given their mutual connection to the Blue Book
Project, I'm afraid Earle may have targeted the Major.
TRUMAN
For what?
ANDY
Interesting.
They look over at Andy, who is still completely engrossed in the painting. Cooper and
Truman are in proximity to the bonsai tree.
COOPER
I don't know yet. All of this appears to be flowing
together. Earle's been seeking access to the Black Lodge
as far back as 1965. This chess game may involve more
pieces than we'd begun to imagine. And then there's the
peculiar circumstances of Josie's death to consider.
TRUMAN
Consider them how?
COOPER
When Josie died ... I'm sorry I haven't mentioned this
before, Harry, but I had to take into account your mental
state -
TRUMAN
What is it?
COOPER
She was trembling with fear. Quaking, like an animal. I
might even venture a guess to say that it was fear that
killed her. And in the moment of her death ... I saw Bob.
As if he'd slipped in through a crevice in time. Upon
reflection, I believe there's a connection between his
appearance and Josie's fear. He was attracted by it. He
may even feed off it.
TRUMAN
You see any connection between Bob and the Black Lodge?
COOPER
I think it's where he comes from. I believe the Black
Lodge is the source of what you've traditionally referred
to here as the evil in the woods. If that's what Earle is
seeking, it's imperative that we find our way in before he
does. There's a source of power in that place far beyond
our ability to comprehend.

6.  WINDOM EARLE'S CABIN
Windom Earle, listening in on his shortwave set, springs out of his chair in excitement.
EARLE
Eureka! Dale, I could kiss your pointy little head. It's
fear! It's fear, Leo, that's the key!
(begins packing one of his silver briefcases)
My favorite emotional state and all this time it's been
staring me in the kisser. Leo, it's marvelous, a
perfect fit. These night creatures that hover on the edge of
our nightmares are drawn to us when we radiate fear, it's
their bread and butter, a perfect symbiosis. And to gain
entrance to their realm, a simple offering, the suffering of
innocence, Oh, nature, perfect in design and aspect, you
do not disappo Leo, look lively, victory is at hand.
We know where the entrance is. We know when the lock
appears and now we hold the key in our hands.
He takes the photos down and packs them, then closes the suitcase. He lifts the other case.
EARLE
Forgive my hasty departure, dear one. But the time has
come to gather my beloved Queen and embark upon our
dark honeymoon. I haven't been this excited since I
punctured Caroline's aorta.
(beat)
Leo, we must share a final sentiment ...
We still cannot see Leo.
EARLE
During our time together in this verdant bower, I must
confess I've developed something of a fondness for you.
Sounding board, companion. Ever obedient and faithful.
An all-around "A" for effort, Leo. Though I'm still a
trifle miffed at your release of Major Briggs. But then
You'll have plenty of time to reflect upon that, won't you?
Goodbye, Leo. And good luck.
As he goes, we PAN DOWN to Leo, who is very tightly shackled. He is holding the end of a
string taut in his mouth. We FOLLOW the string directly above his head and see that it is
holding a large suspended plastic bag shut. Inside the bag are dozens of deadly spiders.

7.  ROADHOUSE - DAY
A line of Miss Twin Peaks contestants in black dance leotards rehearse the opening number.
They include, amongst some faces we do not know, DONNA, Shelly, Annie, LUCY,
Audrey, NADINE and LANA. Standing before them, sleeves up, a cigarette bobbing in his
mouth, is the impresario and choreographer, the ubiquitous TIM PINKLE. The piano player,
TRUDY, jumps back into a show tune and the girls begin their chorus line dance.
PINKLE
Okay, one and two.. and three...
(doing the moves with them)
Step forward one and over and two....
The girls continue on their own as Pinkle steps over to a table and takes a large pull off his
submarine sandwich.
PINKLE
(through his chewing)
Let the mood carry you... don't be afraid to be
vulnerable... and give me just a little more leg...

Now bend forward, like sap in the... er, sapling in the

The song ends. Audrey eyes their trainer warily.
PINKLE
You girls'll need a lot of work...
(belch)
...but if you stay with it, I think I can make dancers out of
you.
(taking her aside)
Especially you, Miss Horne.
AUDREY
What kind of dance was this, Mr. Pinkle?
PINKLE
A nature dance, my little friend. A celebration.
AUDREY
What are we celebrating when you have us all bending
over?
PINKLE
Don't question the vision of your choreographer. You're

ANNIE
This is the weirdest thing I have ever seen.
LANA
I think it't just the greatest thing that ever happened.
PINKLE

Once more with feeling, girls. I only have three things to
say: energy, energy, energy.
ANGLE OFF them over to a booth where the three judges, Norma, TREMAYNE, and
Milford sit watching, and discussing.
TREMAYNE
If talent's to be any part of our deliberations, we'd best
close our eyes until Pinkie's done wrecking havoc.
MILFORD

I love a chorus line.
NORMA

If we can focus here for a second, I have to get back to the

TREMAYNE.
Personally, I've always been big on style.
NORMA
That should be enough to work with. I'll make up the

TREMAYNE
Terrific.
She goes. Milford eyes Tremayne. Business time.

Sorry Insensitive of me.
MILFORD
She'd make a great Miss Twin Peaks.

10.  GREAT NORTHERN/COOPER'S ROOM - DAY
Cooper sits crosslegged on the floor, perfectly still, eyes closed: he is deep in meditation.
Slowly he opens his eyes. Holds for a moment, takes a deep breath. Smiles broadly. Still
crosslegged, he reaches over and flips on his tape recorder.
COOPER
Diane, it's 1:15 PM. I've just concluded my second
meditations of the day in lieu of sleep. I am completely
refreshed and struck again by the realization that we all
live at a fraction of our potential. We've been working
round the clock on the cave hieroglyph. I know the
answer is in that crude etching and I am now convinced
that Windom Earle is searching for the same thing we are,
and for diametrically opposite reasons. If I'm correct in
my assumptions about the power of that unholy place ...
God help us if he gets there first.
Cooper pauses, clearly shaken by the implication. Then, quietly:

meeting someone like Annie to realize how gray my life
has been since Caroline's death, how cold and solitary -
A knock on the door. Cooper rises to answer it.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
Although occasionally there is something to be said for
solitude.
He flips off the recorder, opens the door. Annie stands before him. He admits her.
COOPER
You have nearly perfect timing.
ANNIE
That's not what our choreographer says.
COOPER
What can I do for you, Annie?
ANNIE
I have to give a speech in six hours. I haven't written a
word and I don't have a thought in my hand. I am in a
complete, sweaty-palmed panic and I needed to talk to
someone, namely you.
COOPER
What's the topic?
ANNIE
"What You Can Do to Save Our Local Forests." So what
am I supposed to do, stand up there like a deranged
Barbie Doll, "make sure you're campfires are completely
out, kind of like my brain."
COOPER
You're I terrified of public speaking.

Trees aren't the same as people ...

But they're alive.
COOPER
(extending the metaphor)
Your forest ... is beautiful and very peaceful.
ANNIE
Part of it's been damaged. I've tried to replant, but
nothing's taken root ...
They kiss. Tentatively at first. Then with greater fervor.
COOPER
Let's not talk anymore about trees.
ANNIE
To be honest, that's not really why I'm here. The speech.
COOPER
The way I feel transcends metaphor. Obliterates it.
ANNIE
How do you feel? I mean, usually. I only ask because ...
well, actually, I want to know.
COOPER
(an analytic detour)
My habit is to construct and control my emotions with
great precision. Everything ordered and in its place.
What I am feeling now has steamrollered every barrier
I've ever, if you'll excuse the expression, erected. I don't

START ON a standing screen in the dark living room of the Hurley house. Slides projected
upon it. just now: Nadine in wrestling garb, slamming some hapless opponent to the mat.
NADINE'S VOICE
... and this is me with last year's regional champion from
Yakima. He was cute. But a little slow. Next!
The slide changes. Nadine now appears atop a dazed opponent, a referee counts beside them,
about to slam his hand on the to mat to signal "pin".

NADINE seated, peers proudly at the screen. MIKE, ED, and Norma are arrayed on the
couch behind her. All equally uncomfortable, but determined to play along. DR. JACOBY

NADINE
And this is me with Brock Farmington, Triple A
champion from Spokane. Unbeaten in eighty previous
matches, superior upper body strength, thighs like bridge
supports...

I pinned him in a minute five. Next!

Thank you, Nadine. You're probably wondering why

buns in the hall at school.
JACOBY
And... how are you feeling now?

Well. A little guilty, I guess. I mean Mike and I are

I'm a show business natural. I mean because I'm so happy.
I worry about Ed being sad.
JACOBY
Ed, are you sad?
ED
(god knows he's confused)
No.
JACOBY
Nadine. How does that make you feel?
NADINE
It makes me feel like maybe it's time for us to get on
with our lives the best way we know how. And leave the
past behind us.

something will bubble up. Harry, we're in trouble. If the
door to the Black Lodge does exist, it probably exists
only in time. An object like a door normally exists at a
point in space and time. By way of contrast, a shooting
star exists for us at a point in time over a continuim in
space, but looking at it from the star's point of view
might be an entirely different experience.
TRUMAN
Sorry, you lost me.
COOPER
If we're not at the right place at exactly the right time
we'll never find the way in.
ANDY

They both look over at Andy, who remains fixated on the drawing.
ANDY
Could the 4H Club have anything to do with all this?
TRUMAN
Doubtful, Andy.

Cooper and Annie exit, taking slow steps out into the day.
COOPER
I'm sorry about this. I mean work. Having to be here
instead of ... you know ...
ANNIE
Guess this isn't a good day to fall in love.
COOPER
It's a great day. I'm just not used to feeling such discord
between my professional and personal concerns.
ANNIE
I'm not used to feeling what I feel right now either.
COOPER
Like a force of nature.
ANNIE
I think I may have found the inspiration for my speech.
COOPER
I think we may have found a lot of things ...
ANNIE
Don't say too much. You don't want to jinx us.
COOPER
No. I just don't want to lose you.
ANNIE
(she kisses him)
Go back to work. My heart will start beating again when
next we meet. My knight in shining armor.
He smiles. Watches her go. Hooked.

15.  BLUE PINE LODGE - DAY
The room is spread with power tools, hand tools, gloves, soldering irons. PAN UP to a
counter converted into a work bench, and on to a vice containing a small black box. Standing
around the clamp are CATHERINE MARTELL, ANDREW PACKARD and PETE
MARTELL.
ANDREW
This has to be the last one. Look at it.
CATHERINE
I can't take any more of this. Boxes inside boxes...
What's in there could be worth a fortune.
ANDREW
Maybe it's not a box at all. Maybe it's just a block of
stainless steel.

Eckhardt's last little joke.
PETE
Be a good one.
CATHERINE
(rolling her eyes)
Let's channel some of that high wit into the job.
PETE
I just don't believe a little crumb like that can stand up to
this Cram Jack All Duty Vise.
ANDREW
Again?
PETE
Again.
Pete sits up on the counter, Andrew standing beside him. Pete locks his hands across the vise's
leverage bar. Andrew leans against his brother-in-law, both hands pulling down on his
shoulders.
PETE (CONT'D)
On three. One.. two... three.
Pete paratroops down off the counter, with his whole body weight against the vise bar. Andrew
yanks down on his shoulders, but one hand slips free, causing Pete's vise grip to loosen for an
instant, sending both Pete and Andrew to the floor behind the counter. Andrew stands back up
and yanks the box free of the vise and throws it to the floor in front of Catherine.

CATHERINE
Oh, good, Andrew, perhaps if you yell long and loud
enough it will open by itself.
ANDREW
Do you have any better ideas, Catherine?
Pete pulls himself back up from behind the counter using the handle of the vise for balance. He
comes back down on the vise, which slams shut against Andrew's hand.
Packard SCREAMS.
PETE
Sorry, Andrew.
Pete loosens the vise, freeing Andrew's left hand. The man is in indescribable pain. He looks
down at his hand. Pain instantly turns to rage. He pulls out a gun we didn't know he had.
Pete's eyes bug out.
CATHERINE
What are you doing? He didn't mean it...
ANDREW
Where's it?
CATHERINE
Where's what?
ANDREW
There it is.
The tiny box. Halfway across the room. Andrew fires. It flies. He fires again. And again.
CATHERINE
Andrew, no!!
And again. And again. He puts the gun down.
ANDREW
Damned boxes.
Pete comes out from behind the counter and walks over to the far corner of the room, into
which are lodged the box's remains.

She sits down beside the desk. Andrew sits on the other side of the desk. A beat. They'll

16.  HAYWARD HOUSE - DAY
Donna comes down the stairs in a black sequined gown, hair and makeup meticulously done.
She enters the living room where Doc and EILEEN HAYWARD gaze at her proudly.
DOC
(a trace wistful)
You look truly beautiful.
EILEEN
Read us your speech.
But Donna's expression reveals a completely different agenda.
DONNA
Right now, I'd prefer to talk about the truth.
EILEEN
What truth is there?
DONNA
Something is going on between you and Ben Home. I
want to know what it is.

Pause. Eileen and Doc look at each other, agonized.
DONNA
If you won't tell me, I'll have to find out what I want
from Ben Horne.
EILEEN
No ...
DONNA
Then tell me.
Silence. Eileen looks away.
DONNA
Understand. This is your choice, not mine. And you've
made it.
She heads for the door. Doc comes to his feet.
DOC
Donna -
But she is gone.

17.  CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Deputy Andy brings fresh coffee into the conference room. He pauses to resume his
contemplation of the cave painting on the blackboard. Andy sets down the coffee, moves even
closer. Truman and Cooper confer nearby. Cooper has surrounded himself with various books
and charts. He finds something.
COOPER
Andy, take a look at this: it's what you mistook for the
4H Club; the 4 and H are astrological symbols -
ANDY
You mean like planets?
(CONTINUED)
#2.021
25.
17. CONTINUED:
COOPER
Yes, they're the symbols for Jupiter and Saturn. Some of
these other symbols are planetary as well. What this
paticular part of the puzzle seems to signify is a specific
planetary position: Jupiter and Saturn in conjunction.
TRUMAN
What's that supposed to mean?
COOPER
Historically, when Jupiter and Saturn are conjunct, large
shifts occur in power and fortune. Jupiter is expansive in
its influence; Saturn, contractive. Conjunction suggests a
state of concentration, intensification. What we have
indicated here is something potentially explosive.
(mind racing)
Taking into account the earth's rotation, planetary
positions are specific down to the last second ...
(searching through books)
... and according to the Ephemeris, taking the other
planetary positions on the wall into account, this
conjunction will occur in our part of the world ...
His finger stops. Cooper looks up. Surprised, concerned.
TRUMAN
When?
COOPER
Tonight. At midnight.
(an intuitive leap)
My God, Harry, the door to the Lodge, that's when it
opens. That's what the puzzle's telling us.
BRIGGS
Protect ... the Queen ...
COOPER
(hyperfocused)
If the door is open tonight then something else here must
tell us where. We need to decipher the rest of this,
immediately. Think, anything that looks familiar ...
They look intently.
BRIGGS
Fear and love ... open the doors.
COOPER
What did he say?

TRUMAN
He said "Fear and love open the doors."
COOPER
(another flash)
Two Lodges, two doors. Fear opens one, the Black.
Love, the other.
TRUMAN
What does that mean?
COOPER
I don't know exactly. It just came to me.
BRIGGS
(a looped smile: Hamlet)
"How does the Queen?"
Cooper and Truman exchange looks. Cooper's on a roll.
COOPER
Of course: the Queen.
TRUMAN
Romania?
COOPER
No. The chess game's final piece. Follow my thinking.
Earle takes the Queen ...
TRUMAN
The game's not over until you take the King.
COOPER
That depends on where he takes her. Maybe he takes her to
the doorway when it opens ...
TRUMAN
Which Queen are we talking about?
Andy, as if psychically awakened by this climate of collective revelation, suddenly goes
dumbstruck. For the first time, he looks away from the board, over at Cooper and Truman.
ANDY

respectfully kneels to pick it up, and discovers...
TRUMAN
This plant... has a bug.
He pulls out and holds up the electronic device.
COOPER
This Bonsai wasn't from Josie. It was from Earle.

He's way ahead of us, Harry. And we've been working for
Earle from the start. What time does that conest start?

TRACKING SHOT of the other contestants, who all form a chorus line in their leotards and
dancing pumps. A small band plays the opening number as we  amongst the
girls: Audrey's detachment, Shelly's enjoyment, Donna's preoccupation, Annie's awkwardness,
Lana's sultriness, Lucy's disorientation, Nadine's hopefulness, and the enthusiastic, nameless
faces of others.  through the audience, showing the three judges, Norma,
Tremayne and Milford, the troubled Doc Hayward, the inebriated Pinkle, then finally
PANNING OVER to where the LOG LADY stands, watching.
The number ends to generous applause. Doc Hayward pauses in the wings, staring at Donna,
hoping garner her attention. But she stares ahead, will not meet his gaze. Hayward steps to
the microphone. He's got a lot on his mind.
DOC
Good evening, everyone. Hope you've all had a good
holiday. And welcome to the Miss Twin Peaks Pageant,
in which one of these lovely, talented young citizens will
be crowned Miss Twin Peaks.
(applause)
Now, commencing the talent segment of the show is Lucy
Moran.
Lucy steps forward, to the piano intro of Off Broadway. She looks awkwardly into the
audience, shrugs, then breaks into a jazz dance that is shockingly good. The stagelight narrows
to enclose her.
Backstage, BOBBY BRIGGS, tomorrow's superstar, wanders about in a loose-fitting suit
scoping out the crowd for possible opportunity. Not much. At a distance, he sees the Log
Lady and shakes his head.
BOBBY
Strictly small-town.
Turning his head in another direction, he then sees... the Log Lady. He quickly turns back to
the prior spot: no one. Thoroughly confused, he marches on over to the second Log lady, who
is standing off in a corner, working quietly and efficiently at a power junction box.
BOBBY
Excuse me.. did you invite family to this thing?
The question is met with a deep stare. Suddenly the Log Lady hefts her log, CRACKS Bobby
across the head, knocking him over, and out. CLOSE ON the 'Log Lady' until we can see,
behind her glasses, the eyes of Windom Earle.

Lana steps forward, to some recorded sensual Near East rhythms.

Cooper and Truman hurry into the Roadhouse. Already planning, eyes scanning the crowd for
trouble.
TRUMAN
We're pulling in deputies from all over to surround the
place. They should be here within the hour.
COOPER
It's essential that whoever wins this contest receive full
police protection: 24-hour guard, house surveillance,
everything.
TRUMAN

Truman heads one way, Cooper the other. HOLD SHOT as Andy now arrives, frustrated.

Cooper moves carefully through the crowd, eyes right and left. Then he pauses, looks up. And
spots a catwalk overhead. He pauses to wonder. Then turns his eyes back to the stage.

24. STAGE - LATER
Audrey in the middle of her pageant theme speech.
AUDREY
There is only one way to save a forest, an idea, or
anything of value: and that is by refusing to stand by and
watch it die. There is a law of nature which is more
fundamental to life than the laws of man. And when
something you care about is in danger, you must act to
save it, or lose it forever.

And that is what I, as Miss Twin Peaks or as Audrey
Horne, intend to do.
Applause.

Andy, continuing his search for Cooper, happens upon the still disguised Earle.

Hello, Miss Log Lady.
No reply. Earle is just hoping he'll go away.

quite right. He spots someone across the room.
ANDY

Agent Cooper.
Andy races off. CAMERA REMAINS. And reveals what Andy just missed. A siren horn
attached to the backstage wall, new wiring, a timing device. Carefully installed by Windom
Earle.

26. STAGE - LATER
Annie giving her speech.
ANNIE
... and to illustrate my point, I'd like to read these words
from Chief Seattle, leader of the Suquamish tribe:
"Your dead... are soon forgotten and never return. Our
dead never forget the beautiful world that gave them
being. They still love its verdant valleys, its murmuring
rivers, its magnificent mountains, sequestered vales and
verdant lined lakes and bay and even yearn in tender, fond
affection over the lonely hearted living, and often return
from the Happy Hunting Ground to visit, guide, console
and comfort them."
A hush has fallen over the crowd. She folds up her paper.
27. CUTAWAY - CATWALK
Windom Earle, now undisguised, darts along the catwalk overhead. He attaches another device
to a sandbag line, sets the timer. That's when Annie's voice catches his attention from below.
Earle pauses, peers down at her with rapt expression.

28. BACK TO SCENE
ANNIE
Why have we all lost touch with this beauty? We tell
ourselves the world is not alive so that we won't feel its
pain. But instead we feel it all the more. Maybe saving a
forest starts with preserving the little feelings that die
inside us every day. Those parts of ourselves we deny.
Because if that interior land is not honored, then neither
will we honor the land we walk. Thank you very much.
She walks off to a salvo of applause. INTER show Cooper, who has been conferring
with a deputy, pausing to watch her exit with evident emotion. And Tremayne, who looks
swept away, and finally ... Windom Earle, in the catwalks above.

Donna, and Audrey. We then PAN over to, and HOLD on, Annie.

commence and we will then announce our winner.

Cooper climbs up to the catwalk, hurls himself atop it. He draws his gun, looks ahead.
Windom Earle stands at the other end, grinning from ear to ear. As the pandemonium
continues below:
COOPER
Windom. Don't move.
Cooper takes careful steps along the catwalk, gun aimed at Earle's chest. Looking out for
traps, deadly surprises. Oddly, Earle says nothing, merely grins. A ghoulish apparition
positioned in the far shadows.
EARLE
Dear heart. You are, if nothing else, consistent. As you
have no doubt realized, our little game of fourdimmensional chess has concluded. And once, dear,
dim, Dale - you have left your Queen unprotected.

Forgive me. I amuse myself. You see, twenty years ago I
made a promise. And tonight, I keep it ... in the Black

Earle holds up his arms to conduct an invisible orchestra. Then he slashes downward - and
SUDDENLY the lights go out. MUTED SOUNDS of little explosives going off: smoke
bombs. A COLORED STROBE LIGHT begins flashing, exposing in pulsations the growing
pall of smoke. A SIREN then starts wailing through the room. Screams erupt in concordance,
people are now scurrying about in panic. On the catwalk, Cooper races forward, lights
flashing, smoke obscuring... only to find that Windom Earle is gone.
On stage, pandemonium, the girls huddle in fright. A sandbag falls from above, LANDS on
Nadine's head. More pandemonium, screams. CLOSE ON Annie, her own acute fear.
Suddenly she hears a voice in the dark.
VOICE
(supernaturally gentle)
Don't be afraid. Let me help you.
A hand reaches out to her. Annie takes it, tentative. Once in its grasp, Annie is JERKED
forward. Face to face with her captor, Windom Earle. Annie tries to SCREAM. Earle whips
her away into the dark.
Cooper leaps down from the catwalk, now searching for Annie as well as his nemesis.
COOPER
ANNIE!
Suddenly: the siren STOPS. Chaos everywhere. Cooper fights his way through the crowd,
eyes searching. Annie is nowhere in sight.
Truman hurries over. Cooper stares out into the darkness, hopeless. The strobe dies. Smoke
is clearing.
TRUMAN
Everyone's okay.
COOPER
He took Annie. He took Annie.
TRUMAN
I'll get everybody on it. Bastard won't get half a mile

Truman moves off purposefully. Cooper continues staring out ahead. Andy arrives, at wit's

Cooper stops at the door. Edgy.

Stow it, Coop. Let's roll.
They exit.

4.  HURLEY HOUSE - NIGHT
NADINE HURLEY blances a large ice pack on her head, mind thoroughly elsewhere.
MIKE NELSON escorts DOC HAYWARD to the door.
HAYWARD
Twenty minutes on, twenty minutes off. That should
reduce the swelling. Don't forget the aspirin.
MIKE
Thanks, Doc.
Hayward exits. Mike steps back to Nadine, settles on the couch beside her. Nadine stares
straight ahead, into the dim future.
MIKE
Does it hurt much, baby?

Mike lifts the ice bag, gently kisses the growing knot on Nadine's head.

God, Nadine I was so worried about you. I admit there

each other, but seeing that sandbag hit you, I knew that
I'd practically do anything for you.
NADINE
Who?
MIKE
(deep breathe)
I love you. There I said it and I'm glad.
Mike gently cups her chin, turns Nadine's face toward him, offers a passionate kiss. But
Nadine pulls free, looks at him with complete surprise. And a palpable lack of recognition.
NADINE
Who are you?
MIKE
Mike.
NADINE
You try to stick your tongue down my throat and then, as
some sort of explanation, you say your name is Mike?
What the hell are you doing in my house, anyway?!
MIKE
You, you brought me here.
NADINE
Bullpucky. Take a hike, bozo.
Nadine swats at him. Mike braces for a powerful blow only to fend off a feminine slap. ED
and NORMA walk in the front door.

Norma, if you don't mind, Ed and I have business to talk
about. Not that it isn't just peachy to see you.
Nadine pauses to look around the living room. As if to see it for the first time.
NADINE
Hey. Where're my drape runners?
A beat. Ed steps forward. Gulp.
ED
Nadine, how old are you?
NADINE
What kind of stupid question is that?
ED

She turns away. Earle reaches over. Pulls her hand from her pocket. A rosary is in her hand.
EARLE
Oh, man, what a cheater! Sister Mary Holy Water crams

(grabs the rosary and tosses it out the window,
slides closer to her)
Hey, you want to know something? Cooper's birthday is
April 19th, 1956. That means his moon is in Aries. Get
it?
This is lost on Annie. Earle goes into a rage.
EARLE
You don't get it, do you, you pathetic little professional

He kisses her passionately. She struggles. Earle laughs.
EARLE
I tell ya, doll, if I was ten years younger and could find
the heater in this truck - boy, oh, boy. Having some fun

He opens the truck door.
EARLE
Won't you join me for a gambol in the grove?
He drags Annie out of the truck, and into the woods.

Earle and Annie enter the circle of twelve trees. Then Earle circles her, stalking.
ANNIE
What are we doing here?
EARLE
A momentary pause in limbo, dear. Please be patient.
Pity young Dale will miss all the fun. I always felt we
were sort of Lodge Brothers.
ANNIE
He'll find you. He'll come for me.
EARLE

Do you see him anywhere? Huh? Huh?
Annie seems very calm, closes her eyes, whispers prayers to herself.
EARLE
Prayers? What a revolting development.
Earle checks his watch. Frustrated. She's not scaring.

I'll take it from here, Harry. Alone. Cover me.

This is how it's supposed to be.
Truman stops. Realizes the truth of what he's saying.

Cooper races ahead.

Earle and Annie in the dark grove.
EARLE
You and I have an appointment at the end of the world.

If only Young Dale had lived to see it.
ANNIE
He's not dead.
EARLE
Oh, Cooper's dead, alright. Gone and soon forgotten.
Good riddance to bad rubbish. Didn't I mention it? I
meticulously splattered his brains across the back of the
Roadhouse just before we left.

Poor studious little Dale. Never saw it coming. Not
even time for one of his pithy observations. You see, he

Caroline, the unfaithful whore, she died quickly. Much
better than she deserved. Don't be so prissy. There's
nothing serious in mortality. Renown and grace come
afterward. In fact, they come right here. Here in this
place the nectar of life will be drawn.
Earle moves towards her. Annie screams, terrified. Behind her the doorway to the Lodge
begins to open, a hole in space. Earle is crazed with joy. A benediction.

Annie turns and seems to be trying to run away, getting nowhere.

ANDREW

I've seen this somewhere...
Andrew has an idea. He rifles through the desk, finds a large ring of keys, tagged for easy
identification. Mill Office. Cadillac. Tool Shed. And last... Twin Peaks Savings and Loan. He
lifts the jar, fingers the key, holds it up for closer inspection, compares it to the first. Same
make, same model.
ANDREW
The Savings and Loan!
Just then: the sound of the kitchen door OPENING. Andrew tears the tag off the second key,
places it under the bell jar, [pockets the first. He looks up to see Pete, eyeing him with
disapproval.] And pockets the first. Andrew hurries out of the room. A beat. CATHERINE
enters, tip-toes like her brother toward the desk. She looks left and right, makes certain no one

Twin Peaks Savings and Loan vault to protest their
financial ties to the Ghostwood Development Project,
and that she intends to stay here until a town meeting is

Useful for what?
EARLE
Why do you think, silly boy? For FUN.
He points the remote at him again and presses the button. A blinding flash of light.

35.  RED ROOM
Cooper comes to, lying on the floor of the red room. He rouses himself, looks around.
Hearing someone humming.
COOPER
Where am I?
A crude, hand-painted sign falls into view. It reads: PITTSBURGH, STUPID. The sign flies
up out of sight.
Cooper locates the source of the humming: a WOMAN in a pretty dress stands with her back
to him, at a sink in a small kitchen area.

COOPER (CONTINUED)
Caroline ... oh my God ... Caroline?
No response. The humming grows louder. Cooper advances on the figure.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
Caroline?
The humming stops. The figure tenses but doesn't turn. Cooper moves closer.
COOPER (CONTINUED)
Caroline, it's me ... it's Dale.
Cooper is right behind the figure. He slowly reaches a hand out, touches the figure tentatively
on the shoulder. We hear a low GROWLING and then the figure turns. It's Annie. As
Caroline.
ANNIE
Dale, oh my God, you startled me. I thought it might be
Windom.
(she embraces him)
Thank God you're here, I've missed you so much.
COOPER
(genuinely)
I've missed you too.
ANNIE
I've been so frightened. I had the most terrible dream.
COOPER
What was it?
ANNIE
I saw the face of the man. The face of the man who killed
me.
Cooper draws back.
ANNIE (CONTINUED)
I know who it is. It's the same man who kidnapped me,
the man who gave me the drug. It was Windom, Dale. It
was him all along.
Cooper stares at her.
ANNIE (CONTINUED)
What's the matter? Don't you believe me? It's my

husband. He's the killer. He's the one I saw. We've got
to stop him.
COOPER
You said the face of the man who killed you.
ANNIE
Did I? You must be mistaken. I'm alive.
Pause. Cooper seems close to tears.
COOPER
... Annie?
ANNIE
Who's Annie?
Cooper looks around. Speaks to the unseen Earle.
COOPER
Leave her alone. Tell me what you want, just leave her
alone.
36. A spotlight comes up on Earle, in top hat and tails. Big band music. Earle sings.
EARLE
"Long ago a glimpse of stocking was looked on as
something, now Heaven knows, anything goes."
The light blacks out. Cooper turns back the other way and sees ...
37. A SHADOWY FIGURE ...
...lurking behind Annie, in a slouch hat, holding a long, thin gleaming medical instrument.
COOPER
Windom...
Windom looks up from under the hat and winks at him, then directs Cooper's attention to
another part of the room where ...
38. A distraught Earle ...
... sits with two POLICE OFFICERS, describing a crime scene.
EARLE
I came in the door. There was blood on the kitchen

floor. I followed it into the living room ... that's where
they were lying ...
Cooper looks over and sees ... Annie, pale and quite obviously dead, lying in the arms of
Cooper's "double" ...
EARLE (CONTINUED)
I thought they were both dead. I knew that because I
stabbed them myself.
Earle reveals the medical instrument. Blood on its tip. The double opens its black, lifeless
eyes and stares at Cooper.
COOPER
Don't do this. Don't hurt her. Tell me what you want!

39. THE BLACK CORRIDOR
Cooper and Earle are standing side by side.
EARLE
(casual as an old school chum)
That's more like it. Sorry to put you through that, old
boy, but I did need to secure your cooperation. Don't
worry about your girlfriend. She's alive, of course -
COOPER
What do you want?
EARLE
Actually, I need you to volunteer for something. A
mission for a man of singular quality -
COOPER
Tell me.
EARLE
(friendly and jovial)
Come along with me.
He opens a door. Gestures for Cooper to precede him. Cooper does. Earle follows.

40. NT. THRONE ROOM
A black and white doctor's office. Plain. Non-threatening. Two steps lead up to a dentist's
chair on a elevated rostrum.

EARLE
Some people, I won't name names, they call the place
Hell. I don't have to tell you what they call the other
place. Needless to say, they've got it all backwards.
This is the place of power. The other's a revolting
mixture of milk-curdling sentimentality and bland
acquiescence to the cosmic equivalent of good table
manners. See, there's Annie.
He points casually to a medical supply cabinet, where Annie is trapped, alive, behind glass.
EARLE (CONTINUED)
In case of emergency, break glass.
(turning back to Cooper)
Here's the deal, Dale. Throne room. Windom.
Windom sits on throne. Windom king. Windom happy.
Problem: Windom need to make deposit first. That's
how it works. Windom can't make deposit all by
himself. Windom un-happy.
COOPER
What kind of deposit?
EARLE
Here's where the designers show their ingenuity. In return
for the best seat in the house they want something in
return. Guess what: voluntarily offered, no strings
attached, by its owner and operator ... the soul of a good
human being. Naturally something I have in very short
supply.
(close to him)
That's where you come in.
COOPER
You'll let her go. You'll let her live.
EARLE
(smiles)
Why, Dale, it's as if you read my mind.
COOPER
All right, let's do it. Now. Fast.
EARLE
Lovely. Stand over there.
A light illuminates a single square of the black and white checkerboard floor. Cooper moves

to it. Another light illuminates the dentist chair. A third hits Annie. Everything else goes
BLACK. Earle moves to the dentist chair, sits and sing happily.
EARLE (CONTINUED)
"Back in the saddle again, out where an Indian's your
friend, where everything is green and you can pee right
into the stream ... back in the saddle again."
A rumbling SOUND. Something approaching. Earle sits back and claps his hands like an
excited child. A DOOR OPENS. A MAN in a version of a white dentist's smock enters,
pushing a covered tray. We can't see his face. He stops next to the chair.
EARLE (CONTINUED)
Oh goody.
Suddenly clamps spring out of the arms and legs of the chair. Another slithers around
Windom's neck while yet another gags him.
The Dentist uncovers the table, revealing an array of loathsome medical instruments. The
Dentist picks up a particularly nasty one, a huge syringe, and turns to face them ... it's killer
BOB. Earle squirms, screams. We hear Bob's voice, but his lips don't move.
BOB'S VOICE
(to Cooper, moving towards him)
If you know what's good for you, and you do, don't
move.
(Cooper doesn't)
The fool broke the rules: it's really no good if you don't
volunteer. Doesn't count if you're coerced. He'll have to
be punished and he will be ...
(close to him)
Of course that doesn't mean we have to let you go. This
is for extracting.
Bob grins and is about to use the syringe on Cooper when a HAND reaches in and stops him.
They both turn to look and see ... Laura. Alarm on. Bob's face. A SOUND of two
tremendous energies colliding. A WHITE LIGHT fills the room. Cooper looks to Annie,
who's calling for him silently.
FADE TO WHITE:
FADE IN:
41.  WOODS - DAY
Fighting off fatigue, Truman moves around, stretching. Looking back to the grove he sees
someone lying in its center. Truman runs to them. It's Cooper and Annie, both unconscious.

TRUMAN
Cooper? Cooper!
(into his walkie-talkie)
Andy, get that ambulance up here right now - Cooper?
He realizes there's blood on Annie's blouse. Cooper opens his eyes.
TRUMAN (CONTINUED)
Coop, you okay? Coop? You okay?
Cooper slowly shakes his head and closes his eyes again. SOUND of a siren in the distance.

42.  GREAT NORTHERN COOPER'S ROOM - NIGHT
Wearing pajamas, Cooper lies in bed. Doc Hayward and Truman attend him. Cooper opens
his eyes again.
DOC
Here he is.
TRUMAN
Coop ...
COOPER
Where am I?
TRUMAN
Your room at the Great Northern. Annie's gonna be okay.
She's in the hospital.
Pause.
DOC
You've had quite a shock. Everything checks out, though.
You're going to be fine.
TRUMAN
I can't tell you how worried we were. I saw you
disappear. God almighty ...
COOPER
(pause)
I'd like to brush my teeth.
TRUMAN
Okay, sure, good.
Let me help you up.

COOPER
Thank you.
Cooper walks slowly to the bathroom and closes the door.

43.  COOPER'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
Cooper looks at the sink, at his personal effects, he picks up the toothbrush, squeezes some
toothpaste on it and lifts it to his mouth. He holds it in front of his mouth, looks into the
mirror and smiles brightly. Looking into the mirror, staring back at him, is the face of Bob.
